14.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as
grouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially
in the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying
widths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain
numerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central
tendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study
of these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of
grouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the
cumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called
ogives.
14.2 Mean of Grouped Data
The mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the
observations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if
x1
, x2,. . ., xn
 are observations with respective frequencies f
1, f2
, . . ., fn
, then this
means observation x1
 occurs f
1
 times, x2 occurs f
2
 times, and so on.
Now, the sum of the values of all the observations = f1x1 + f2x2 + . . . + fnxn, and
the number of observations = f1
 + f2
 + . . . + f
n
.
So, the mean x of the data is given by
x = 11 2 2

Let us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example.
Example 1 : The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a
Mathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the
mean of the marks obtained by the students.

Solution: Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each xi
 with
the corresponding frequency f
i
. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 14.1.

Therefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3.
In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful
study it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped
data into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean.
Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming
class-intervals of width, say 15. Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each
class-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next
class, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the classinterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped
frequency distribution table (see Table 14.2).
Table 14.2
Class interval 10 - 25 25 - 40 40 - 55 55 - 70 70 - 85 85 - 100
Number of students 23766 6
Now, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the
representative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each classinterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each
class can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we
find the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and
lower limits. That is,
Class mark =
Upper class limit + Lower class limit
2
With reference to Table 14.2, for the class 10 -25, the class mark is
10 25
2 , i.e.,
17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put
them in Table 14.3. These class marks serve as our xi
’s. Now, in general, for the ith
class interval, we have the frequency f
i
 corresponding to the class mark xi
. We can
now proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.

given data is given by

   
This new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method.
We observe that Tables 14.1 and 14.3 are using the same data and employing the
same formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different.
Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the
two values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 14.3, 59.3 being the exact
mean, while 62 an approximate mean.
Sometimes when the numerical values of xi
 and f
i
 are large, finding the product
of xi and fi
 becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of
a method of reducing these calculations.
We can do nothing with the fi
’s, but we can change each xi
 to a smaller number
so that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a
fixed number from each of these xi
’s? Let us try this method.
The first step is to choose one among the xi
’s as the assumed mean, and denote
it by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that xi
which lies in the centre of x1
, x2, . . ., xn. So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let
us choose a = 47.5.
The next step is to find the difference di
 between a and each of the xi
’s, that is,
the deviation of ‘a’ from each of the xi
’s.
i.e., di
 = xi
 – a = xi
 – 47.5
264 MATHEMATICS
The third step is to find the product of di
 with the corresponding f
i
, and take the sum
of all the fi di
’s. The calculations are shown in Table 14.4.

So, from Table 14.4, the mean of the deviations, d = i i
i

f

 .
Now, let us find the relation between d and x .
Since in obtaining di
, we subtracted ‘a’ from each xi
, so, in order to get the mean
x , we need to add ‘a’ to d . This can be explained mathematically as:
Mean of deviations, d = i i

Substituting the values of a, Σf

 from Table 14.4, we get
x =

30
 .
Therefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method.
Activity 1 : From the Table 14.3 find the mean by taking each of xi (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,
and so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in
each case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)
So, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the
choice of ‘a’.
Observe that in Table 14.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if
we divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to
multiply with f
i
. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)
So, let ui
 = i x a
h
 , where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size.
Now, we calculate ui
 in this way and continue as before (i.e., find fi ui and
then Σf
i
ui
). Taking h = 15, let us form Table 14.5.

So, the mean marks obtained by a student is 62.
The method discussed above is called the Step-deviation method.
We note that :
 the step-deviation method will be convenient to apply if all the di
’s have a
common factor.
 The mean obtained by all the three methods is the same.
 The assumed mean method and step-deviation method are just simplified
forms of the direct method.
 The formula x = a + hu still holds if a and h are not as given above, but are
any non-zero numbers such that ui
 = i x a
h

Let us apply these methods in another example.

Remark : The result obtained by all the three methods is the same. So the choice of
method to be used depends on the numerical values of xi

. If xi and f
i are
sufficiently small, then the direct method is an appropriate choice. If xi and f
i are
numerically large numbers, then we can go for the assumed mean method or
step-deviation method. If the class sizes are unequal, and xi are large numerically, we
can still apply the step-deviation method by taking h to be a suitable divisor of all the di

14.3 Mode of Grouped Data
Recall from Class IX, a mode is that value among the observations which occurs most
often, that is, the value of the observation having the maximum frequency. Further, we
discussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining
a mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same
maximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though
grouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a
single mode only.
Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following
example.
Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:
2645021323
Find the mode of the data.
Solution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:
Number of 0123456
wickets
Number of 1132111
matches
STATISTICS 273
Clearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number
(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2.
In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by
looking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum
frequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is
given by the formula:
Mode = 1 0
10 2 2
f f l h
ff f
          
where l = lower limit of the modal class,
h = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),
f1 = frequency of the modal class,
f
0
 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,
f
2
 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.
Let us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula.
Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students
resulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a
household:
Family size 1 - 3 3 - 5 5 - 7 7 - 9 9 - 11
Number of 78221
families
Find the mode of this data.
Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this
frequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5.
Now
modal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l ) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2
frequency ( f1 ) of the modal class = 8,
frequency ( f
0 ) of class preceding the modal class = 7,
frequency ( f
2 ) of class succeeding the modal class = 2.
Now, let us substitute these values in the formula :

Therefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286.
Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are
given in Table 14.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and
interpret the mode and the mean.
Solution : Refer to Table 14.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students
(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,
the lower limit (l ) of the modal class = 40,
the class size (h) = 15,
the frequency ( f1 ) of modal class = 7,
the frequency ( f0 ) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,
the frequency ( f 2) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6.
Now, using the formula:
Mode = 1 0
10 2 2

we get Mode =

So, the mode marks is 52.
Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62.
So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a

Remarks :
1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may
be equal or more than the mean also.
2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the
average marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most

of the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation,
the mode is required.
Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations
assigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data. They should also
compare this with the mean, and interpret the meaning of both.
Remark : The mode can also be calculated for grouped data with unequal class sizes.
However, we shall not be discussing it.

14.4 Median of Grouped Data
As you have studied in Class IX, the median is a measure of central tendency which
gives the value of the middle-most observation in the data. Recall that for finding the
median of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in
ascending order. Then, if n is odd, the median is the
1

  n 
   th observation. And, if n
is even, then the median will be the average of the th
2
n and the 1 th
2
  n
     observations.
Suppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the
marks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :
Marks obtained 20 29 28 33 42 38 43 25
Number of students 6 28 24 15 2 4 1 20
First, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as
follows :

    th observations, i.e., the 50th and 51st observations. To find these
observations, we proceed as follows:
Table 14.10
Marks obtained Number of students
20 6
upto 25 6 + 20 = 26
upto 28 26 + 24 = 50
upto 29 50 + 28 = 78
upto 33 78 + 15 = 93
upto 38 93 + 4 = 97
upto 42 97 + 2 = 99
upto 43 99 + 1 = 100
Now we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table
above and name it as cumulative frequency column.

Remark : The part of Table 14.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as
Cumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that
about 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained
marks more than 28.5.
Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following
situation.
Consider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53
students, in a certain examination, as follows:
Table 14.12
Marks Number of students
0 - 10 5
10 - 20 3
20 - 30 4
30 - 40 3
40 - 50 3
50 - 60 4
60 - 70 7
70 - 80 9
80 - 90 7
90 - 100 8
From the table above, try to answer the following questions:
How many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5.
280 MATHEMATICS
How many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number
of students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have
scored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks
from 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8.
We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10 -20 is 8.
Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,
the number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We
give them in Table 14.13 given below:
Table 14.13
Marks obtained Number of students
(Cumulative frequency)
Less than 10 5
Less than 20 5 + 3 = 8
Less than 30 8 + 4 = 12
Less than 40 12 + 3 = 15
Less than 50 15 + 3 = 18
Less than 60 18 + 4 = 22
Less than 70 22 + 7 = 29
Less than 80 29 + 9 = 38
Less than 90 38 + 7 = 45
Less than 100 45 + 8 = 53
The distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of
the less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective
class intervals.
We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more
than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From
Table 14.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to
0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there
are 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks. Continuing in the
same manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or
above as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 14.14.
STATISTICS 281

More than or equal to 40 41 – 3 = 38
More than or equal to 50 38 – 3 = 35
More than or equal to 60 35 – 4 = 31
More than or equal to 70 31 – 7 = 24
More than or equal to 80 24 – 9 = 15
More than or equal to 90 15 – 7 = 8
The table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more
than type. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals.
Now, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these
cumulative frequency distributions.
Let us combine Tables 14.12 and 14.13 to get Table 14.15 given below:
Table 14.15
Marks Number of students ( f) Cumulative frequency (cf)
0 - 10 5 5
10 - 20 3 8
20 - 30 4 12

50 - 60 4 22
60 - 70 7 29
70 - 80 9 38
80 - 90 7 45
90 - 100 8 53
Now in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by
looking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in
282 MATHEMATICS
a class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides
the whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be?
To find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and 2
n
.
We now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to)
2
n  This is called the median class. In the distribution above, n = 53. So, 2
n
 = 26.5.
Now 60 – 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest
to) 2
n
, i.e., 26.5.
Therefore, 60 – 70 is the median class.
After finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the
median.
Median =
cf
2 + ,
n

    

where l = lower limit of median class,
n = number of observations,
cf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,
f = frequency of median class,
h = class size (assuming class size to be equal).
Substituting the values 26.5,
2
n  l = 60, cf = 22, f = 7, h = 10
in the formula above, we get
Median =
26.5 22 60 10

        

= 66.4
So, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have
scored marks more than 66.4.

Example 7 : A survey regarding the heights (in cm) of 51 girls of Class X of a school

Less than 145 11
Less than 150 29
Less than 155 40
Less than 160 46
Less than 165 51
Find the median height.
Solution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their
corresponding frequencies.
The given distribution being of the less than type, 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the
upper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,
140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find
that there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval
below 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with
height less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval
140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for
150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the
given cumulative frequencies becomes:

l (the lower limit) = 145,
cf (the cumulative frequency of the class preceding 145 - 150) = 11,
f (the frequency of the median class 145 - 150) = 18,

So, the median height of the girls is 149.03 cm.
This means that the height of about 50% of the girls is less than this height, and
50% are taller than this height.

So, x =9
Therefore, from (1), we get 9 + y = 24
i.e., y = 15
286 MATHEMATICS
Now, that you have studied about all the three measures of central tendency, let
us discuss which measure would be best suited for a particular requirement.
The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it
takes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, i.e., the largest
and the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or
more distributions. For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students
of different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a
better performance.
However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of
classes having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data.
But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,
21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such
cases, the mean is not a good representative of the data.
In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find
out a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical
productivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations
where extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as
a better measure of central tendency.
In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular
item, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being
watched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by
most of the people, etc.
Remarks :
1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :
3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean
2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated. However,
we shall not discuss it here.

14.5 Graphical Representation of Cumulative Frequency Distribution
As we all know, pictures speak better than words. A graphical representation helps us
in understanding given data at a glance. In Class IX, we have represented the data
through bar graphs, histograms and frequency polygons. Let us now represent a
cumulative frequency distribution graphically.
For example, let us consider the cumulative frequency distribution given in
Table 14.13.
290 MATHEMATICS
Recall that the values 10, 20, 30,
. . ., 100 are the upper limits of the
respective class intervals. To represent
the data in the table graphically, we mark
the upper limits of the class intervals on
the horizontal axis (x-axis) and their
corresponding cumulative frequencies
on the vertical axis ( y-axis), choosing a
convenient scale. The scale may not be
the same on both the axis. Let us now
plot the points corresponding to the
ordered pairs given by (upper limit,
corresponding cumulative frequency),
i.e., (10, 5), (20, 8), (30, 12), (40, 15),
(50, 18), (60, 22), (70, 29), (80, 38), (90, 45), (100, 53) on a graph paper and join them
by a free hand smooth curve. The curve we get is called a cumulative frequency
curve, or an ogive (of the less than type). (See Fig. 14.1)
The term ‘ogive’ is pronounced as ‘ojeev’ and is derived from the word ogee.
An ogee is a shape consisting of a concave arc flowing into a convex arc, so
forming an S-shaped curve with vertical ends. In architecture, the ogee shape
is one of the characteristics of the 14th and 15th century Gothic styles.
Next, again we consider the cumulative frequency distribution given in
Table 14.14 and draw its ogive (of the more than type).
Recall that, here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90
are the lower limits of the respective class
intervals 0 - 10, 10 - 20, . . ., 90 - 100. To
represent ‘the more than type’ graphically,
we plot the lower limits on the x-axis and
the corresponding cumulative frequencies
on the y-axis. Then we plot the points
(lower limit, corresponding cumulative
frequency), i.e., (0, 53), (10, 48), (20, 45),
(30, 41), (40, 38), (50, 35), (60, 31),
(70, 24), (80, 15), (90, 8), on a graph paper,
and join them by a free hand smooth curve.
The curve we get is a cumulative frequency curve, or an ogive (of the more than
type). (See Fig. 14.2)

STATISTICS 291

Fig. 14.4
Remark : Note that both the ogives (in Fig. 14.1 and Fig. 14.2) correspond to the
same data, which is given in Table 14.12.
Now, are the ogives related to the median in any way? Is it possible to obtain the
median from these two cumulative frequency curves corresponding to the data in
Table 14.12? Let us see.
One obvious way is to locate
53 26.5
2 2
n   on the y-axis (see Fig.
14.3). From this point, draw a line parallel
to the x-axis cutting the curve at a point.
From this point, draw a perpendicular to
the x-axis. The point of intersection of
this perpendicular with the x-axis
determines the median of the data (see
Fig. 14.3).
Another way of obtaining the
median is the following :
Draw both ogives (i.e., of the less
than type and of the more than type) on
the same axis. The two ogives will
intersect each other at a point. From this
point, if we draw a perpendicular on the
x-axis, the point at which it cuts the
x-axis gives us the median (see Fig. 14.4).
Example 9 : The annual profits earned by 30 shops of a shopping complex in a
locality give rise to the following distribution :
Profit (in lakhs `) Number of shops (frequency)
More than or equal to 5 30
More than or equal to 10 28
More than or equal to 15 16
More than or equal to 20 14
More than or equal to 25 10
More than or equal to 30 7
More than or equal to 35 3
292 MATHEMATICS
Draw both ogives for the data above.
Hence obtain the median profit.
Solution : We first draw the coordinate
axes, with lower limits of the profit along
the horizontal axis, and the cumulative
frequency along the vertical axes. Then,
we plot the points (5, 30), (10, 28), (15, 16),
(20, 14), (25, 10), (30, 7) and (35, 3). We
join these points with a smooth curve to
get the ‘more than’ ogive, as shown in
Fig. 14.5.
Now, let us obtain the classes, their
frequencies and the cumulative frequency
from the table above.
Table 14.17
Classes 5 - 10 10 - 15 15 - 20 20 - 25 25 - 30 30 - 35 35 - 40
No. of shops 2 12 2 4 3 4 3
Cumulative 2 14 16 20 23 27 30
frequency
Using these values, we plot the points
(10, 2), (15, 14), (20, 16), (25, 20), (30, 23),
(35, 27), (40, 30) on the same axes as in
Fig. 14.5 to get the ‘less than’ ogive, as
shown in Fig. 14.6.
The abcissa of their point of intersection is
nearly 17.5, which is the median. This can
also be verified by using the formula.
Hence, the median profit (in lakhs) is
Rs 17.5.
Remark : In the above examples, it may
be noted that the class intervals were
continuous. For drawing ogives, it should
be ensured that the class intervals are
continuous. (Also see constructions of
histograms in Class IX)

1. The following distribution gives the daily income of 50 workers of a factory.
Daily income (in `) 100 - 120 120 - 140 140 - 160 160 - 180 180 - 200
Number of workers 12 14 8 6 10
Convert the distribution above to a less than type cumulative frequency distribution,
and draw its ogive.
2. During the medical check-up of 35 students of a class, their weights were recorded as
follows:
Weight (in kg) Number of students
Less than 38 0
Less than 40 3
Less than 42 5
Less than 44 9
Less than 46 14
Less than 48 28
Less than 50 32
Less than 52 35
 Draw a less than type ogive for the given data. Hence obtain the median weight from
the graph and verify the result by using the formula.
3. The following table gives production yield per hectare of wheat of 100 farms of a village.
Production yield 50 - 55 55 - 60 60 - 65 65 - 70 70 - 75 75 - 80

5. Representing a cumulative frequency distribution graphically as a cumulative frequency
curve, or an ogive of the less than type and of the more than type.
6. The median of grouped data can be obtained graphically as the x-coordinate of the point
of intersection of the two ogives for this data.
A NOTE TO THE READER
For calculating mode and median for grouped data, it should be
ensured that the class intervals are continuous before applying the
formulae. Same condition also apply for construction of an ogive.
Further, in case of ogives, the scale may not be the same on both the axes.
