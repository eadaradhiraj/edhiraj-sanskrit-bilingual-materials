3.1 Introduction
You must have come across situations like the one given below :
Akhila went to a fair in her village. She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel
and play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if
the ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played
Hoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs
Rs 3, and a game of Hoopla costs Rs 4, how would you find out the number of rides
she had and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent Rs 20.
May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it
possible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge
of Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables.

IN TWO VARIABLES
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 39
Let us try this approach.
Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she
played Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:
y =
1
2
x (1)
3x + 4y = 20 (2)
Can we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of
finding these, which we will study in this chapter.
3.2 Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables
Recall, from Class IX, that the following are examples of linear equations in two
variables:
2x + 3y =5
x – 2y – 3 = 0
and x – 0y = 2, i.e., x = 2
You also know that an equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0,
where a, b and c are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear
equation in two variables x and y. (We often denote the condition a and b are not both
zero by a2
 + b2 ≠ 0). You have also studied that a solution of such an equation is a
pair of values, one for x and the other for y, which makes the two sides of the
equation equal.
For example, let us substitute x = 1 and y = 1 in the left hand side (LHS) of the
equation 2x + 3y = 5. Then
LHS = 2(1) + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5,
which is equal to the right hand side (RHS) of the equation.
Therefore, x = 1 and y = 1 is a solution of the equation 2x + 3y = 5.
Now let us substitute x = 1 and y = 7 in the equation 2x + 3y = 5. Then,
LHS = 2(1) + 3(7) = 2 + 21 = 23
which is not equal to the RHS.
Therefore, x = 1 and y = 7 is not a solution of the equation.
Geometrically, what does this mean? It means that the point (1, 1) lies on the line
representing the equation 2x + 3y = 5, and the point (1, 7) does not lie on it. So, every
solution of the equation is a point on the line representing it.
40 MATHEMATICS
In fact, this is true for any linear equation, that is, each solution (x, y) of a
linear equation in two variables, ax + by + c = 0, corresponds to a point on the
line representing the equation, and vice versa.
Now, consider Equations (1) and (2) given above. These equations, taken
together, represent the information we have about Akhila at the fair.
These two linear equations are in the same two variables x and y. Equations
like these are called a pair of linear equations in two variables.
Let us see what such pairs look like algebraically.
The general form for a pair of linear equations in two variables x and y is
a1x + b1 y + c1
 =0
and a2x + b2 y + c2
 = 0,
where a1
, b1
, c1
, a2
, b2
, c2
 are all real numbers and a1
2
 + b1
2 ≠ 0, a2
2
 + b2
2 ≠ 0.
Some examples of pair of linear equations in two variables are:
2x + 3y – 7 = 0 and 9x – 2y + 8 = 0
5x = y and –7x + 2y + 3 = 0
x + y = 7 and 17 = y
Do you know, what do they look like geometrically?
Recall, that you have studied in Class IX that the geometrical (i.e., graphical)
representation of a linear equation in two variables is a straight line. Can you now
suggest what a pair of linear equations in two variables will look like, geometrically?
There will be two straight lines, both to be considered together.
You have also studied in Class IX that given two lines in a plane, only one of the
following three possibilities can happen:
(i) The two lines will intersect at one point.
(ii) The two lines will not intersect, i.e., they are parallel.
(iii) The two lines will be coincident.
We show all these possibilities in Fig. 3.1:
In Fig. 3.1 (a), they intersect.
In Fig. 3.1 (b), they are parallel.
In Fig. 3.1 (c), they are coincident.
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 41
Fig. 3.1
Both ways of representing a pair of linear equations go hand-in-hand — the
algebraic and the geometric ways. Let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Let us take the example given in Section 3.1. Akhila goes to a fair with
Rs 20 and wants to have rides on the Giant Wheel and play Hoopla. Represent this
situation algebraically and graphically (geometrically).
Solution : The pair of equations formed is :
y =
1
2 x
i.e., x – 2y = 0 (1)
3x + 4y = 20 (2)
Let us represent these equations graphically. For this, we need at least two
solutions for each equation. We give these solutions in Table 3.1.

(i) (ii)
Recall from Class IX that there are infinitely many solutions of each linear
equation. So each of you can choose any two values, which may not be the ones we
have chosen. Can you guess why we have chosen x = 0 in the first equation and in the
second equation? When one of the variables is zero, the equation reduces to a linear
42 MATHEMATICS
equation in one variable, which can be solved easily. For instance, putting x = 0 in
Equation (2), we get 4y = 20, i.e., y = 5. Similarly, putting y = 0 in Equation (2), we get
3x = 20, i.e., x =
20
3 . But as
20
3 is
not an integer, it will not be easy to
plot exactly on the graph paper. So,
we choose y = 2 which gives x = 4,
an integral value.
Plot the points A(0, 0), B(2, 1)
and P(0, 5), Q(4, 2), corresponding
to the solutions in Table 3.1. Now
draw the lines AB and PQ,
representing the equations
x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y = 20, as
shown in Fig. 3.2.
In Fig. 3.2, observe that the two lines representing the two equations are
intersecting at the point (4, 2). We shall discuss what this means in the next section.
Example 2 : Romila went to a stationery shop and purchased 2 pencils and 3 erasers
for ` 9. Her friend Sonali saw the new variety of pencils and erasers with Romila, and
she also bought 4 pencils and 6 erasers of the same kind for ` 18. Represent this
situation algebraically and graphically.
Solution : Let us denote the cost of 1 pencil by ` x and one eraser by ` y. Then the
algebraic representation is given by the following equations:
2x + 3y = 9 (1)
4x + 6y = 18 (2)
To obtain the equivalent geometric representation, we find two points on the line
representing each equation. That is, we find two solutions of each equation.

We plot these points in a graph
paper and draw the lines. We find that
both the lines coincide (see Fig. 3.3).
This is so, because, both the
equations are equivalent, i.e., one can
be derived from the other.
Example 3 : Two rails are
represented by the equations
x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0.
Represent this situation geometrically.
Solution : Two solutions of each of
the equations :
x + 2y – 4 = 0 (1)
2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (2)
are given in Table 3.3

To represent the equations graphically, we plot the points R(0, 2) and S(4, 0), to
get the line RS and the points P(0, 3) and Q(6, 0) to get the line PQ.
44 MATHEMATICS
We observe in Fig. 3.4, that the
lines do not intersect anywhere, i.e.,
they are parallel.
So, we have seen several
situations which can be represented
by a pair of linear equations. We
have seen their algebraic and
geometric representations. In the
next few sections, we will discuss
how these representations can be
used to look for solutions of the pair
of linear equations.
EXERCISE 3.1
1. Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years ago, I was seven times as old as you were then.
Also, three years from now, I shall be three times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this
interesting?) Represent this situation algebraically and graphically.
2. The coach of a cricket team buys 3 bats and 6 balls for ` 3900. Later, she buys another
bat and 3 more balls of the same kind for ` 1300. Represent this situation algebraically
and geometrically.
3. The cost of 2 kg of apples and 1kg of grapes on a day was found to be ` 160. After a
month, the cost of 4 kg of apples and 2 kg of grapes is ` 300. Represent the situation
algebraically and geometrically.
3.3 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations
In the previous section, you have seen how we can graphically represent a pair of
linear equations as two lines. You have also seen that the lines may intersect, or may
be parallel, or may coincide. Can we solve them in each case? And if so, how? We
shall try and answer these questions from the geometrical point of view in this section.
Let us look at the earlier examples one by one.
 In the situation of Example 1, find out how many rides on the Giant Wheel
Akhila had, and how many times she played Hoopla.
In Fig. 3.2, you noted that the equations representing the situation are
geometrically shown by two lines intersecting at the point (4, 2). Therefore, the
Fig. 3.4
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 45
point (4, 2) lies on the lines represented by both the equations x – 2y = 0 and
3x + 4y = 20. And this is the only common point.
Let us verify algebraically that x = 4, y = 2 is a solution of the given
pair of equations. Substituting the values of x and y in each equation, we get
4 – 2 × 2 = 0 and 3(4) + 4(2) = 20. So, we have verified that x = 4, y = 2 is a
solution of both the equations. Since (4, 2) is the only common point on both
the lines, there is one and only one solution for this pair of linear equations
in two variables.
Thus, the number of rides Akhila had on Giant Wheel is 4 and the number
of times she played Hoopla is 2.
 In the situation of Example 2, can you find the cost of each pencil and each
eraser?
In Fig. 3.3, the situation is geometrically shown by a pair of coincident
lines. The solutions of the equations are given by the common points.
Are there any common points on these lines? From the graph, we observe
that every point on the line is a common solution to both the equations. So, the
equations 2x + 3y = 9 and 4x + 6y = 18 have infinitely many solutions. This
should not surprise us, because if we divide the equation 4x + 6y = 18 by 2 , we
get 2x + 3y = 9, which is the same as Equation (1). That is, both the equations are
equivalent. From the graph, we see that any point on the line gives us a possible
cost of each pencil and eraser. For instance, each pencil and eraser can cost
` 3 and ` 1 respectively. Or, each pencil can cost ` 3.75 and eraser can cost
` 0.50, and so on.
 In the situation of Example 3, can the two rails cross each other?
In Fig. 3.4, the situation is represented geometrically by two parallel lines.
Since the lines do not intersect at all, the rails do not cross. This also means that
the equations have no common solution.
A pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of
linear equations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is
called a consistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are
equivalent has infinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a
dependent pair of linear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of
linear equations is always consistent.
We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations
in two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:
46 MATHEMATICS
(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations
has a unique solution (consistent pair of equations).
(ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution
(inconsistent pair of equations).
(iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many
solutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations].
Let us now go back to the pairs of linear equations formed in Examples 1, 2, and
3, and note down what kind of pair they are geometrically.
(i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)
(ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)
(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)
Let us now write down, and compare, the values of 11 1

In fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by
considering some more examples by yourself.
Let us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.
Example 4 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations
x + 3y = 6 (1)
and 2x – 3y = 12 (2)
is consistent. If so, solve them graphically.
Solution : Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two
solutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.5

Plot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0),
P(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph
paper, and join the points to form the
lines AB and PQ as shown in
Fig. 3.5.
We observe that there is a point
B (6, 0) common to both the lines
AB and PQ. So, the solution of the
pair of linear equations is x = 6 and
y = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations
is consistent.
48 MATHEMATICS
Example 5 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,
unique solution or infinitely many solutions:
5x – 8y + 1 = 0 (1)
3x – 24
5 y +
3
5 = 0 (2)
Solution : Multiplying Equation (2) by
5 ,
3 we get
5x – 8y + 1 = 0
But, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)
and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.
Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.
Example 6 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her
friends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of
skirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts
is four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find
how many pants and skirts Champa bought.
Solution : Let us denote the number of pants by x and the number of skirts by y. Then
the equations formed are :
y =2x – 2 (1)
 and y =4x – 4 (2)
Let us draw the graphs of
Equations (1) and (2) by finding two
solutions for each of the equations.
They are given in Table 3.6.

Plot the points and draw the lines passing through them to represent the equations,
as shown in Fig. 3.6.
The two lines intersect at the point (1, 0). So, x = 1, y = 0 is the required solution
of the pair of linear equations, i.e., the number of pants she purchased is 1 and she did
not buy any skirt.
Verify the answer by checking whether it satisfies the conditions of the given
problem.

3.4 Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations
In the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically.
The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the
solution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like  3, 2 7  ,
(–1.75, 3.3),
4 1 , 13 19
      , etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading
such coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are
several algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss.
3.4.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking
some examples.
Example 7 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:
7x – 15y = 2 (1)
x + 2y = 3 (2)
Solution :
Step 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other.
Let us consider the Equation (2) :
x + 2y =3
and write it as x = 3 – 2y (3)
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 51
Step 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get
7(3 – 2y) – 15y =2
i.e., 21 – 14y – 15y =2
i.e., – 29y = –19
Therefore, y =
19
29
Step 3 : Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get
x = 3 – 19 2
29
      =
49
29
Therefore, the solution is x =
49
29 , y =
19
29 .
Verification : Substituting x =
49
29 and y =
19
29 , you can verify that both the Equations
(1) and (2) are satisfied.
To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:
Step 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from
either equation, whichever is convenient.
Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in
one variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and
10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can
conclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement
is false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in
Step 1 to obtain the value of the other variable.
Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of
the other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is
known as the substitution method.
Example 8 : Solve Q.1 of Exercise 3.1 by the method of substitution.
Solution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively.
Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is
s – 7 = 7 (t – 7), i.e., s – 7t + 42 = 0 (1)
and s + 3 = 3 (t + 3), i.e., s – 3t = 6 (2)
52 MATHEMATICS
Using Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6.
Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get
(3t + 6) – 7t + 42 = 0,
i.e., 4t = 48, which gives t = 12.
Putting this value of t in Equation (2), we get
s = 3 (12) + 6 = 42
So, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively.
Verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems.
Example 9 : Let us consider Example 2 in Section 3.3, i.e., the cost of 2 pencils and
3 erasers is ` 9 and the cost of 4 pencils and 6 erasers is ` 18. Find the cost of each
pencil and each eraser.
Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:
2x + 3y = 9 (1)
4x + 6y = 18 (2)
We first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get
x =
9 3
2
 y (3)
Now we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get
4(9 3 )
2
 y + 6y = 18
i.e., 18 – 6y + 6y = 18
i.e., 18 = 18
This statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific value
of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This situation has
arisen bcause both the given equations are the same. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2)
have infinitely many solutions. Observe that we have obtained the same solution
graphically also. (Refer to Fig. 3.3, Section 3.2.) We cannot find a unique cost of a
pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the given situation.
Example 10 : Let us consider the Example 3 of Section 3.2. Will the rails cross each
other?
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 53
Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:
x + 2y – 4 = 0 (1)
2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (2)
We express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get
x = 4 – 2y
Now, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get
2(4 – 2y) + 4y – 12 = 0
i.e., 8 – 12 = 0
i.e., – 4 = 0
which is a false statement.
Therefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not
cross each other.

3.4.2 Elimination Method
Now let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable. This
is sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method
works.
Example 11 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their
expenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their
monthly incomes.
Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their
expenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation
is given by :
9x – 4y = 2000 (1)
and 7x – 3y = 2000 (2)
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of
y equal. Then we get the equations:
27x – 12y = 6000 (3)
28x – 12y = 8000 (4)
Step 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients
of y are the same. So, we get
(28x – 27x) – (12y – 12y) = 8000 – 6000
i.e., x = 2000
Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get
9(2000) – 4y = 2000
i.e., y = 4000
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 55
So, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes
of the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively.
Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =
18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3
Remarks :
1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,
because we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable.
In the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try
doing it that way.
2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this
problem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient.
Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method :
Step 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make
the coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal.
Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets
eliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3.
If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has infinitely many solutions.
If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original
pair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent.
Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value.
Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the
value of the other variable.
Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples.
Example 12 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following
pair of linear equations :
2x + 3y = 8 (1)
4x + 6y = 7 (2)
Solution :
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the
coefficients of x equal. Then we get the equations as :
4x + 6y = 16 (3)
4x + 6y = 7 (4)
56 MATHEMATICS
Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),
(4x – 4x) + (6y – 6y) = 16 – 7
i.e., 0 = 9, which is a false statement.
Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution.
Example 13 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing
the digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such
numbers are there?
Solution : Let the ten’s and the unit’s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively.
So, the first number may be written as 10 x + y in the expanded form (for example,
56 = 10(5) + 6).
When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit’s digit and y becomes the ten’s
digit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is
reversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5).
According to the given condition.
(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66
i.e., 11(x + y) = 66
i.e., x + y = 6 (1)
We are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,
either x – y = 2 (2)
or y – x = 2 (3)
If x – y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2.
In this case, we get the number 42.
If y – x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4.
 In this case, we get the number 24.
Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24.
Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2.

3.4.3 Cross - Multiplication Method
So far, you have learnt how to solve a pair of linear equations in two variables by
graphical, substitution and elimination methods. Here, we introduce one more algebraic
method to solve a pair of linear equations which for many reasons is a very useful
method of solving these equations. Before we proceed further, let us consider the
following situation.
The cost of 5 oranges and 3 apples is ` 35 and the cost of 2 oranges and 4 apples
is ` 28. Let us find the cost of an orange and an apple.
Let us denote the cost of an orange by ` x and the cost of an apple by ` y. Then,
the equations formed are :
5x + 3y = 35, i.e., 5x + 3y – 35 = 0 (1)
2x + 4y = 28, i.e., 2x + 4y – 28 = 0 (2)
Let us use the elimination method to solve these equations.
Multiply Equation (1) by 4 and Equation (2) by 3. We get
(4)(5)x + (4)(3)y + (4)(–35) = 0 (3)
(3)(2)x + (3)(4)y + (3)(–28) = 0 (4)
Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3), we get
[(5)(4) – (3)(2)]x + [(4)(3) – (3)(4)]y + [4(–35) – (3)(–28)] = 0
58 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, x = –  (4)(–35) (3)( 28)
(5)(4) (3)(2)
 

i.e., x =
(3)(– 28) (4)( 35)
(5)(4) (2)(3)
 
 (5)
If Equations (1) and (2) are written as a1
x + b1
y + c1
 = 0 and a2
x + b2
y + c2
 = 0,
then we have
a1
 = 5, b1
 = 3, c1
 = –35, a2
 = 2, b2
 = 4, c2
 = –28.
Then Equation (5) can be written as x =
12 21
12 21
bc b c
ab ab

 ,
Similarly, you can get y =
12 21
12 21
ca ca
ab ab


By simplyfing Equation (5), we get
x =
84 140
20 6
 
 = 4
Similarly, y =
( 35)(2) (5)( 28)
20 6
 
 =
70 140
14
 
 = 5
Therefore, x = 4, y = 5 is the solution of the given pair of equations.
Then, the cost of an orange is ` 4 and that of an apple is ` 5.
Verification : Cost of 5 oranges + Cost of 3 apples = ` 20 + ` 15 = ` 35. Cost of
2 oranges + Cost of 4 apples = ` 8 + ` 20 = ` 28.
Let us now see how this method works for any pair of linear equations in two
variables of the form
a1
x + b1
y + c1
 = 0 (1)
and a2
x + b2
y + c2
 = 0 (2)
To obtain the values of x and y as shown above, we follow the following steps:
Step 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by b2
 and Equation (2) by b1
, to get
b2
a1
x + b2
b1 y + b2
c1
 = 0 (3)
b1
a2
x + b1
b2 y + b1
c2
 = 0 (4)
Step 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from (3), we get:
(b2
a1
 – b1
a2
) x + (b2
b1
 – b1
b2 ) y + (b2
c1
– b1
c2
) = 0
PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 59
i.e., (b2
a1
 – b1
a2
) x = b1
c2
 – b2
c1
So, x =
12 21
12 21
bc b c
ab a b

 , provided a1
b2 – a2
b1 ≠ 0 (5)
Step 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1) or (2), we get
y =
12 21
12 21
ca ca
ab ab

 (6)
Now, two cases arise :
Case 1 : a1
b2
 – a2
b1 ≠ 0. In this case 1 1
2 2
a b
a b
 . Then the pair of linear equations has
a unique solution.
Case 2 : a1
b2
 – a2
b1
 = 0. If we write 1 1
2 2
a b k
a b   , then a1
 = k a2
, b1
 = k b2
.
Substituting the values of a1
 and b1
 in the Equation (1), we get
k (a2
x + b2 y) + c1
 = 0. (7)
It can be observed that the Equations (7) and (2) can both be satisfied only if
c1
 = k c2
, i.e., 1
2
. c k
c 
If c1
 = k c2
, any solution of Equation (2) will satisfy the Equation (1), and vice
versa. So, if 111
222
abc k
abc  , then there are infinitely many solutions to the pair of
linear equations given by (1) and (2).
If c1 ≠ k c2
, then any solution of Equation (1) will not satisfy Equation (2) and vice
versa. Therefore the pair has no solution.
We can summarise the discussion above for the pair of linear equations given by
(1) and (2) as follows:
(i) When 1 1
2 2
a b
a b
 , we get a unique solution.
(ii) When 111
222
abc

(iii) When 111

In remembering the above result, the following diagram may be helpful to
you :
The arrows between the two numbers indicate that they are to be multiplied and
the second product is to be subtracted from the first.
For solving a pair of linear equations by this method, we will follow the following
steps :
Step 1 : Write the given equations in the form (1) and (2).
Step 2 : Taking the help of the diagram above, write Equations as given in (8).
Step 3 : Find x and y, provided a1
b2 – a2
b1 ≠ 0
Step 2 above gives you an indication of why this method is called the
cross-multiplication method.
Example 14 : From a bus stand in Bangalore , if we buy 2 tickets to Malleswaram and
3 tickets to Yeshwanthpur, the total cost is ` 46; but if we buy 3 tickets to Malleswaram
and 5 tickets to Yeshwanthpur the total cost is ` 74. Find the fares from the bus stand
to Malleswaram, and to Yeshwanthpur.
Solution : Let ` x be the fare from the bus stand in Bangalore to Malleswaram, and
` y to Yeshwanthpur. From the given information, we have
2x + 3y = 46, i.e., 2x + 3y – 46 = 0 (1)
3x + 5y = 74, i.e., 3x + 5y – 74 = 0 (2)
To solve the equations by the cross-multiplication method, we draw the diagram as
given below.

i.e., x = 8 and y = 10
Hence, the fare from the bus stand in Bangalore to Malleswaram is ` 8 and the fare to
Yeshwanthpur is ` 10.
Verification : You can check from the problem that the solution we have got is correct.
Example 15 : For which values of p does the pair of equations given below has unique
solution?
4x + py + 8 = 0
2x + 2y + 2 = 0
Solution : Here a1 = 4, a2

Example 16 : For what values of k will the following pair of linear equations have

which gives k2

Also,

gives 3k = k2
 – 3k, i.e., 6k = k2
, which means k = 0 or k = 6.
Therefore, the value of k, that satisfies both the conditions, is k = 6. For this value, the
pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions.

3.5 Equations Reducible to a Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables
In this section, we shall discuss the solution of such pairs of equations which are not
linear but can be reduced to linear form by making some suitable substitutions. We
now explain this process through some examples.
Example 17 : Solve the pair of equations:

These equations are not in the form ax + by + c = 0. However, if we substitute
1 1
p and q
x y
  in Equations (1) and (2), we get
2p + 3q = 13 (3)
5p – 4q = – 2 (4)
So, we have expressed the equations as a pair of linear equations. Now, you can use
any method to solve these equations, and get p = 2, q = 3.
You know that p =

Equations (3) and (4) form a pair of linear equations in the general form. Now,
you can use any method to solve these equations. We get p =

Now, substituting 1
x 1
for p, we have

i.e., x – 1 = 3, i.e., x = 4.
Similarly, substituting 1
y  2
 for q, we get
1
y  2
 =

i.e., 3 = y – 2, i.e., y = 5
Hence, x = 4, y = 5 is the required solution of the given pair of equations.
Verification : Substitute x = 4 and y = 5 in (1) and (2) to check whether they are
satisfied.
Example 19 : A boat goes 30 km

10 hours. In 13 hours, it can go

still water.
Solution : Let the speed of the boat
in still water be x km/h and speed of
the stream be y km/h. Then the
speed of the boat downstream
= (x + y) km/h,
and the speed of the boat upstream = (x – y) km/h
Also, time =

30u + 44v = 10 or 30u + 44v – 10 = 0 (4)
40u + 55v = 13 or 40u + 55v – 13 = 0 (5)

x y 11  
i.e., x – y = 5 and x + y = 11 (6)
Adding these equations, we get
2x = 16
i.e., x =8
Subtracting the equations in (6), we get
2y =6
i.e., y =3

PAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 69
3.6 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. Two linear equations in the same two variables are called a pair of linear equations in two
variables. The most general form of a pair of linear equations is
a1
x + b1
y + c1
 = 0
a2
x + b2
y + c2
 = 0
where a1
, a2
, b1
, b2
, c1
, c2
 are real numbers, such that 22 22
11 22 ab ab   0, 0.
2. A pair of linear equations in two variables can be represented, and solved, by the:
(i) graphical method
(ii) algebraic method
3. Graphical Method :
The graph of a pair of linear equations in two variables is represented by two lines.
(i) If the lines intersect at a point, then that point gives the unique solution of the two
equations. In this case, the pair of equations is consistent.
(ii) If the lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions — each point on the
line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is dependent (consistent).
(iii) If the lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the
pair of equations is inconsistent.
4. Algebraic Methods : We have discussed the following methods for finding the solution(s)
of a pair of linear equations :
(i) Substitution Method
(ii) Elimination Method
(iii) Cross-multiplication Method
5. If a pair of linear equations is given by a1
x + b1
y + c1
 = 0 and a2
x + b2
y + c2
 = 0, then the
following situations can arise :
(i) 1 1
2 1
a b
a b
 : In this case, the pair of linear equations is consistent.
(ii) 111
222
abc
abc
  : In this case, the pair of linear equations is inconsistent.
(iii) 111
222
abc
abc   : In this case, the pair of linear equations is dependent and consistent.
6. There are several situations which can be mathematically represented by two equations
that are not linear to start with. But we alter them so that they are reduced to a pair of
linear equations.
