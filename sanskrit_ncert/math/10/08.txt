There is perhaps nothing which so occupies the
middle position of mathematics as trigonometry.
– J.F. Herbart (1890)
8.1 Introduction
You have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your
earlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles
can be imagined to be formed. For instance :
1. Suppose the students of a school are
visiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student
is looking at the top of the Minar, a right
triangle can be imagined to be made,
as shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student
find out the height of the Minar, without
actually measuring it?
 2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony
of her house located on the bank of a
river. She is looking down at a flower
pot placed on a stair of a temple situated
nearby on the other bank of the river.
A right triangle is imagined to be made
in this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If
you know the height at which the
person is sitting, can you find the width
of the river?.

3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in
the air. A girl happens to spot the
balloon in the sky and runs to her
mother to tell her about it. Her mother
rushes out of the house to look at the
balloon.Now when the girl had spotted
the balloon intially it was at point A.
When both the mother and daughter
came out to see it, it had already
travelled to another point B. Can you
find the altitude of B from the ground?
In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using
some mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called
‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’
(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,
trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle.
The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early
astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth.
Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and
Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.
In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with
respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict
our discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other
angles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and
90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish
some identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities.
8.2 Trigonometric Ratios
In Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles
imagined to be formed in different situations.
Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown
in Fig. 8.4.
Here, ∠ CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an
acute angle. Note the position of the side BC
with respect to angle A. It faces ∠ A. We call it
the side opposite to angle A. AC is the
hypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB
is a part of ∠ A. So, we call it the side
adjacent to angle A. Fig. 8.4

Note that the position of sides change
when you consider angle C in place of A
(see Fig. 8.5).
You have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in
your earlier classes. We now define certain ratios
involving the sides of a right triangle, and call
them trigonometric ratios.
The trigonometric ratios of the angle A
in right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined
as follows :
sine of ∠ A = side opposite to angle A BC
hypotenuse AC =
cosine of ∠ A = side adjacent to angle A AB
hypotenuse AC =
tangent of ∠ A = side opposite to angle A BC
side adjacent to angle A AB =
cosecant of ∠ A = 1 hypotenuse AC
sine of A side opposite to angle A BC = = ∠
secant of ∠ A = 1 hypotenuse AC
cosine of A side adjacent to angle A AB = = ∠
cotangent of ∠ A = 1 side adjacent to angle A AB
tangent of A side opposite to angle A BC = = ∠
The ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A
and cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,
the reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A.
Also, observe that tan A =
BC
BC sin A AC
AB cos A AB
AC
= = and cot A =
cosA
sin A
.
So, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the
relationship between the angle and the length of its sides.
Why don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right
triangle? (See Fig. 8.5)

The first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use
it today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,
in A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya
for the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or
jiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was
translated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as
it is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which
means curve, when the Arabic version was translated
into Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,
became common in mathematical texts throughout
Europe. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund
Gunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated
notation ‘sin’.
The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function
arose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta
called it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the
English Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’.
Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an
abbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not
the product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A
has no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of
‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other
trigonometric ratios also.
Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse
AC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle
ABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN
perpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how
will the trigonometric ratios of ∠ A in Δ PAM differ
from those of ∠ A in Δ CAB or from those of ∠ A in
Δ QAN?
To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is Δ PAM similar to Δ CAB? From
Chapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the
triangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,
the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.
So, we have
AM
AB
 =
AP MP
AC BC = ⋅

From this, we find
MP
AP
 =
BC sin A
AC = .
Similarly,
AM AB
AP AC = = cos A, MP BC tan A
AM AB = = and so on.
This shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in Δ PAM not differ from
those of angle A in Δ CAB.
In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other
trigonometric ratios) remains the same in Δ QAN also.
From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric
ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if
the angle remains the same.
Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2
A, cos2
A, etc., in place of
(sin A)2
, (cos A)2
, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1 ≠ sin–1 A (it is called sine
inverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes.
Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the
Greek letter θ (theta) is also used to denote an angle.
We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one
of the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see.
If in a right triangle ABC, sin A =
1 ,
3
then this means that
BC 1
AC 3 = , i.e., the
lengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle
ABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So if
BC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where
k is any positive number. To determine other
trigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side
AB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the
required length AB.
AB2
 = AC2
 – BC2
 = (3k)
2
 – (k)2
 = 8k2
 = (2 2 k)2
Therefore, AB = ± 2 2 k
So, we get AB = 2 2 k (Why is AB not – 2 2 k ?)
Now, cos A =
AB 2 2 2 2
AC 3 3
k
k = =
Similarly, you can obtain the other trigonometric ratios of the angle A.

Remark : Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of
sin A or cos A is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).
Let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Given tan A =
4
3 , find the other
trigonometric ratios of the angle A.
Solution : Let us first draw a right Δ ABC
(see Fig 8.8).
Now, we know that tan A =
BC 4
AB 3 = .
Therefore, if BC = 4k, then AB = 3k, where k is a
positive number.
Now, by using the Pythagoras Theorem, we have
AC2
 = AB2
 + BC2
 = (4k)2
 + (3k)2
 = 25k2
So, AC = 5k
Now, we can write all the trigonometric ratios using their definitions.
sin A =
BC 4 4
AC 5 5
k
k = =
cos A =
AB 3 3
AC 5 5
k
k = =
Therefore, cot A =
13 15 , cosec A =
tan A 4 sin A 4 = = and sec A =
1 5
cos A 3 = ⋅
Example 2 : If ∠ B and ∠ Q are
acute angles such that sin B = sin Q,
then prove that ∠ B = ∠ Q.
Solution : Let us consider two right
triangles ABC and PQR where
sin B = sin Q (see Fig. 8.9).
We have sin B = AC
AB
and sin Q =
PR
PQ

Then
AC
AB =
PR
PQ
Therefore,
AC
PR
 =
AB
, say PQ = k (1)
Now, using Pythagoras theorem,
BC = 2 2 AB AC −
and QR = 2 2 PQ – PR
So,
BC
QR =
2 2 22 22 2 2
2 2 22 22
AB AC PQ PR PQ PR
PQ PR PQ PR PQ PR
kk k
k −− − = ==
−− − (2)
From (1) and (2), we have
AC
PR
 =
AB BC
PQ QR =
Then, by using Theorem 6.4, Δ ACB ~ Δ PRQ and therefore, ∠ B = ∠ Q.
Example 3 : Consider Δ ACB, right-angled at C, in
which AB = 29 units, BC = 21 units and ∠ ABC = θ
(see Fig. 8.10). Determine the values of
(i) cos2 θ + sin2 θ,
(ii) cos2 θ – sin2 θ.
Solution : In Δ ACB, we have
AC = 2 2 AB BC − = 2 2 (29) (21) −

So, sin θ =

Example 4 : In a right triangle ABC, right-angled at B,
if tan A = 1, then verify that
2 sin A cos A = 1.
Solution : In Δ ABC, tan A =
BC
AB = 1 (see Fig 8.11)
i.e., BC = AB
Let AB = BC = k, where k is a positive number.
Now, AC = 2 2 AB BC +

Therefore, sin A =
BC 1
AC 2 = and cos A =

AC 2 =
So, 2 sin A cos A = 1 1 2 1,

⎛ ⎞⎛ ⎞ = ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ which is the required value.
Example 5 : In Δ OPQ, right-angled at P,
OP = 7 cm and OQ – PQ = 1 cm (see Fig. 8.12).
Determine the values of sin Q and cos Q.
Solution : In Δ OPQ, we have
OQ2
 = OP2
 + PQ2
i.e., (1 + PQ)2
 = OP2
 + PQ2 (Why?)
i.e., 1 + PQ2
 + 2PQ = OP2
 + PQ2
i.e., 1 + 2PQ = 72 (Why?)
i.e., PQ = 24 cm and OQ = 1 + PQ = 25 cm
So, sin Q =

8.3 Trigonometric Ratios of Some Specific Angles
From geometry, you are already familiar with the construction of angles of 30°, 45°,
60° and 90°. In this section, we will find the values of the trigonometric ratios for these
angles and, of course, for 0°.

Trigonometric Ratios of 45°
In Δ ABC, right-angled at B, if one angle is 45°, then
the other angle is also 45°, i.e., ∠ A = ∠ C = 45°
(see Fig. 8.14).
So, BC = AB (Why?)
Now, Suppose BC = AB = a.
Then by Pythagoras Theorem, AC2
 = AB2
 + BC2
 = a2
 + a2
 = 2a2
,
and, therefore, AC = a 2 ⋅
Using the definitions of the trigonometric ratios, we have :
sin 45° = side opposite to angle 45° BC 1
hypotenuse AC 2 2
a
a == =
cos 45° = side adjacent toangle 45° AB 1
hypotenuse AC 2 2

Also, cosec 45° =
1 2
sin 45 =
° , sec 45° =
1 2
cos 45 =
° , cot 45° =
1 1
tan 45 =
° .
Trigonometric Ratios of 30° and 60°
Let us now calculate the trigonometric ratios of 30°
and 60°. Consider an equilateral triangle ABC. Since
each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°, therefore,
∠ A = ∠ B = ∠ C = 60°.
Draw the perpendicular AD from A to the side BC
(see Fig. 8.15).
Now Δ ABD ≅ Δ ACD (Why?)
Therefore, BD = DC
and ∠ BAD = ∠ CAD (CPCT)
Now observe that:
Δ ABD is a right triangle, right-angled at D with ∠ BAD = 30° and ∠ ABD = 60°
(see Fig. 8.15).

As you know, for finding the trigonometric ratios, we need to know the lengths of the
sides of the triangle. So, let us suppose that AB = 2a.
Then, BD =
1 BC =
2
a
and AD2
 = AB2
 – BD2
 = (2a)
2
 – (a)2
 = 3a2

Therefore, AD = a 3

Trigonometric Ratios of 0° and 90°
Let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of angle
A, if it is made smaller and smaller in the right triangle ABC
(see Fig. 8.16), till it becomes zero. As ∠ A gets smaller and
smaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets
closer to point B, and finally when ∠ A becomes very close
to 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17).

When ∠ A is very close to 0°, BC gets very close to 0 and so the value of
sin A =
BC
AC is very close to 0. Also, when ∠ A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the
same as AB and so the value of cos A =
AB
AC is very close to 1.
This helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when
A = 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1.
Using these, we have :
tan 0° =
sin 0°
cos 0° = 0, cot 0° =
1 , tan 0° which is not defined. (Why?)
sec 0° =
1
cos 0°
 = 1 and cosec 0° = 1 , sin 0° which is again not defined.(Why?)
Now, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of ∠ A, when it is made
larger and larger in Δ ABC till it becomes 90°. As ∠ A gets larger and larger, ∠ C gets
smaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on
decreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when ∠ A is very close to 90°,
∠ C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC
(see Fig. 8.18).
Fig. 8.18
When ∠ C is very close to 0°, ∠ A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the
same as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when ∠ A is very close to 90°,
∠ C is very close to 0°, and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0.
So, we define : sin 90° = 1 and cos 90° = 0.
Now, why don’t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90°?
We shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°
and 90° in Table 8.1, for ready reference.

Remark : From the table above you can observe that as ∠ A increases from 0° to

Let us illustrate the use of the values in the table above through some examples.
Example 6 : In Δ ABC, right-angled at B,
AB = 5 cm and ∠ ACB = 30° (see Fig. 8.19).
Determine the lengths of the sides BC and AC.
Solution : To find the length of the side BC, we will
choose the trigonometric ratio involving BC and the
given side AB. Since BC is the side adjacent to angle
C and AB is the side opposite to angle C, therefore
AB
BC = tan C
i.e.,

BC = tan 30° =

i.e.,

AC
i.e., AC = 10 cm
Note that alternatively we could have used Pythagoras theorem to determine the third
side in the example above,
i.e., AC = 222 2 AB BC 5 (5 3) cm = 10cm. + =+
Example 7 : In Δ PQR, right-angled at
Q (see Fig. 8.20), PQ = 3 cm and PR = 6 cm.
Determine ∠ QPR and ∠ PRQ.
Solution : Given PQ = 3 cm and PR = 6 cm.
Therefore, PQ
PR = sin R
or sin R =
3 1
6 2 =
So, ∠ PRQ = 30°
and therefore, ∠ QPR = 60°. (Why?)
You may note that if one of the sides and any other part (either an acute angle or any
side) of a right triangle is known, the remaining sides and angles of the triangle can be
determined.
Example 8 : If sin (A – B) =
1 ,
2 cos (A + B) =
1 ,
2 0° < A + B ≤ 90°, A > B, find A
and B.
Solution : Since, sin (A – B) =
1
2 , therefore, A – B = 30° (Why?) (1)
Also, since cos (A + B) =
1
2 , therefore, A + B = 60° (Why?) (2)
Solving (1) and (2), we get : A = 45° and B = 15°.

8.4 Trigonometric Ratios of Complementary Angles
Recall that two angles are said to be complementary
if their sum equals 90°. In Δ ABC, right-angled at B,
do you see any pair of complementary angles?

Since ∠ A + ∠ C = 90°, they form such a pair. We have:
sin A =
BC
AC cos A =
AB
AC tan A =
BC
AB
cosec A =
AC
BC sec A =
AC
AB cot A =
AB
BC
(1)
Now let us write the trigonometric ratios for ∠ C = 90° – ∠ A.
For convenience, we shall write 90° – A instead of 90° – ∠ A.
What would be the side opposite and the side adjacent to the angle 90° – A?
You will find that AB is the side opposite and BC is the side adjacent to the angle
90° – A. Therefore,
sin (90° – A) =
AB
AC , cos (90° – A) =
BC
AC , tan (90° – A) =
AB
BC
cosec (90° – A) =
AC
AB , sec (90° – A) =
AC
BC , cot (90° – A) =
BC
AB
(2)
Now, compare the ratios in (1) and (2). Observe that :
sin (90° – A) =
AB
AC = cos A and cos (90° – A) =
BC
AC = sin A
Also, tan (90° – A) =
AB cot A
BC = , cot (90° – A) =
BC tan A
AB =
sec (90° – A) =
AC cosec A
BC = , cosec (90° – A) =
AC sec A
AB =
So, sin (90° – A) = cos A, cos (90° – A) = sin A,
tan (90° – A) = cot A, cot (90° – A) = tan A,
sec (90° – A) = cosec A, cosec (90° – A) = sec A,
for all values of angle A lying between 0° and 90°. Check whether this holds for
A = 0° or A = 90°.
Note : tan 0° = 0 = cot 90°, sec 0° = 1 = cosec 90° and sec 90°, cosec 0°, tan 90° and
cot 0° are not defined.
Now, let us consider some examples.

Example 9 : Evaluate tan 65°
cot 25° .
Solution : We know : cot A = tan (90° – A)
So, cot 25° = tan (90° – 25°) = tan 65°
i.e.,
tan 65°
cot 25°
 =
tan 65° 1
tan 65° =
Example 10 : If sin 3A = cos (A – 26°), where 3A is an acute angle, find the value of
A.
Solution : We are given that sin 3A = cos (A – 26°). (1)
Since sin 3A = cos (90° – 3A), we can write (1) as
cos (90° – 3A) = cos (A – 26°)
Since 90° – 3A and A – 26° are both acute angles, therefore,
90° – 3A = A – 26°
which gives A = 29°
Example 11 : Express cot 85° + cos 75° in terms of trigonometric ratios of angles
between 0° and 45°.
Solution : cot 85° + cos 75° = cot (90° – 5°) + cos (90° – 15°)
= tan 5° + sin 15°

8.5 Trigonometric Identities
You may recall that an equation is called an identity
when it is true for all values of the variables involved.
Similarly, an equation involving trigonometric ratios
of an angle is called a trigonometric identity, if it is
true for all values of the angle(s) involved.
In this section, we will prove one trigonometric
identity, and use it further to prove other useful
trigonometric identities.
In Δ ABC, right-angled at B (see Fig. 8.22), we have:
AB2
 + BC2
 = AC2 (1)
Dividing each term of (1) by AC2
, we get

i.e.,
2 2 AB BC

AC
⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠
i.e., (cos A)2
 + (sin A)2
 =1
i.e., cos2
 A + sin2
 A = 1 (2)
This is true for all A such that 0° ≤ A ≤ 90°. So, this is a trigonometric identity.
Let us now divide (1) by AB2
. We get

Is this equation true for A = 0°? Yes, it is. What about A = 90°? Well, tan A and
sec A are not defined for A = 90°. So, (3) is true for all A such that 0° ≤ A < 90°.
Let us see what we get on dividing (1) by BC2
. We get
2 2
2 2
AB BC

⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠
i.e., cot2 A + 1 = cosec2
 A (4)
Note that cosec A and cot A are not defined for A = 0°. Therefore (4) is true for
all A such that 0° < A ≤ 90°.
Using these identities, we can express each trigonometric ratio in terms of other
trigonometric ratios, i.e., if any one of the ratios is known, we can also determine the
values of other trigonometric ratios.
Let us see how we can do this using these identities. Suppose we know that
tan A =
1
3
⋅ Then, cot A = 3 .
Since, sec2
 A = 1 + tan2
 A = 1 4 1 , 3 3
+ = sec A =
2
3 , and cos A = 3
2 ⋅
Again, sin A = 2 3 1 1 cos A 1
4 2 − = −= . Therefore, cosec A = 2.
Example 12 : Express the ratios cos A, tan A and sec A in terms of sin A.
Solution : Since cos2
 A + sin2
 A = 1, therefore,
cos2
 A = 1 – sin2
 A, i.e., cos A = 2 ± − 1 sin A
This gives cos A = 2 1 sin A − (Why?)
Hence, tan A =
sin A
cos A
 =

sin A 1 1 and sec A =
1 – sin A 1 sin A cos A =

Example 15 : Prove that sin cos 1 1 , sin cos 1 sec tan
θ− θ+ = θ+ θ− θ− θ using the identity
sec2 θ = 1 + tan2 θ.
Solution : Since we will apply the identity involving sec θ and tan θ, let us first
convert the LHS (of the identity we need to prove) in terms of sec θ and tan θ by
dividing numerator and denominator by cos θ.
LHS =
sin – cos + 1 tan 1 sec
sin + cos – 1 tan 1 sec
θ θ θ− + θ = θ θ θ+ − θ

(tan sec ) 1 {(tan sec ) 1} (tan sec )
