4.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the
quadratic polynomial of the form ax2
 + bx + c, a ≠ 0. When we equate this polynomial
to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with
many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a
charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having
a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length
one metre more than twice its breadth. What
should be the length and breadth of the hall?
Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,
its length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict
this information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1.
Now, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m2
 = (2x2
 + x) m2
So, 2x2
 + x = 300 (Given)
Therefore, 2x2
 + x – 300 = 0
So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2
 + x – 300 = 0 which is a
quadratic equation.
Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations.
For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum
and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic
equation of the form x 2
 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a
geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,
are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is
often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)
gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2
 + bx = c. Later,

Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,
(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing
the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied
quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book
‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of
different quadratic equations.
In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding
their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life
situations.
4.2 Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2
 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b, c are real numbers, a ≠ 0. For example, 2x2
 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
Similarly, 2x2
 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4x – 3x2
 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2
 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic
equations.
In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree
2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of
their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax 2 + bx + c = 0,
a ≠ 0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.
Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in
different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.
Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and
the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find
out how many marbles they had to start with.
(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of
production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys
produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was
Rs 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
Solution :
(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x.
Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5
= 40 – x
2015-16 (11-11-2014)
72 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, their product = (x – 5) (40 – x)
= 40x – x2
 – 200 + 5x
= – x2
 + 45x – 200
So, – x2
 + 45x – 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)
i.e., – x2
 + 45x – 324 = 0
i.e., x2
 – 45x + 324 = 0
Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
x2
 – 45x + 324 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x.
Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x)
Therefore, x (55 – x) = 750
i.e., 55x – x2
 = 750
i.e., – x2
 + 55x – 750 = 0
i.e., x2
 – 55x + 750 = 0
Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
x2
 – 55x + 750 = 0
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) (x – 2)2
 + 1 = 2x – 3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)
(iii) x (2x + 3) = x2
 + 1 (iv) (x + 2)3
 = x3
 – 4
Solution :
(i) LHS = (x – 2)2
 + 1 = x2
 – 4x + 4 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 5
Therefore, (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3 can be rewritten as
x2 – 4x + 5 = 2x – 3
i.e., x2
 – 6x + 8 = 0
It is of the form ax2
 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
2015-16 (11-11-2014)
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 73
(ii) Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x2
 + x + 8 and (x + 2)(x – 2) = x2
 – 4
Therefore, x2
 + x + 8 = x2
 – 4
i.e., x + 12 = 0
It is not of the form ax2
 + bx + c = 0.
Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.
(iii) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x2
 + 3x
So, x (2x + 3) = x2
 + 1 can be rewritten as
2x2 + 3x = x2
 + 1
Therefore, we get x2
 + 3x – 1 = 0
It is of the form ax 2
 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
(iv) Here, LHS = (x + 2)3 = x3
 + 6x2
 + 12x + 8
Therefore, (x + 2)3
 = x3
 – 4 can be rewritten as
x3
 + 6x2
 + 12x + 8 = x3
 – 4
i.e., 6x2
 + 12x + 12 = 0 or, x2
 + 2x + 2 = 0
It is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0.
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic
equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.
In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of
degree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As
you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it
is quadratic or not.
EXERCISE 4.1
1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations :
(i) (x + 1)2

(iii) (x – 2)(x + 1) = (x – 1)(x + 3) (iv) (x – 3)(2x +1) = x(x + 5)
(v) (2x – 1)(x – 3) = (x + 5)(x – 1) (vi) x2 + 3x + 1 = (x – 2) 2

(iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been
8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We
need to find the speed of the train.
4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation
Consider the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the
LHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12
) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation.
We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that
1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2
 – 3x + 1.
In general, a real number α is called a root of the quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0, a ≠ 0 if a α2
 + bα + c = 0. We also say that x = α is a solution of
the quadratic equation, or that α satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the
zeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2
 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic
equation ax2
 + bx + c = 0 are the same.
You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most
two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.
You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting
their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic
equation. Let us see how.
Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x2
 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation.
Solution : Let us first split the middle term – 5x as –2x –3x [because (–2x) × (–3x) =
6x2 = (2x2) × 3].
So, 2x2
 – 5x + 3 = 2x2
 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x – 1) –3(x – 1) = (2x – 3)(x – 1)
Now, 2x2
 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0.
So, the values of x for which 2x2
 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0,
i.e., either 2x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0.
Now, 2x – 3 = 0 gives
3
2
x  and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.
So,
3
2
x  and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation.
In other words, 1 and
3
2 are the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0.
Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.
2015-16 (11-11-2014)
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 75
Note that we have found the roots of 2x2
 – 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising
2x2
 – 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.
Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x2
 – x – 2 = 0.
Solution : We have
6x2
 – x – 2 = 6x2
 + 3x – 4x – 2
= 3x (2x + 1) – 2 (2x + 1)
= (3x – 2)(2x + 1)
The roots of 6x2
 – x – 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x – 2)(2x + 1) = 0
Therefore, 3x – 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0,
i.e., x =
2
3 or x =
1
2

Therefore, the roots of 6x2
 – x – 2 = 0 are
2 1 and – . 3 2
We verify the roots, by checking that
2 1
and
3 2  satisfy 6x2
 – x – 2 = 0.
Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 2 3 26 2 0 x x   .
Solution : 2 3 26 2 x x   = 2 3 6 62 x xx 
= 3 3 2 23 2 xx x      
=  3 23 2 x x    
So, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which
  3 23 20 x x    
Now, 3 20 x   for
2
3
x  .
So, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor 3 2 x  .
Therefore, the roots of 2 3 26 2 0 x x   are
2

Example 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1.
Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x
satisfies the equation 2x2
 + x – 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write
this equation as
2x2
 – 24x + 25x – 300 = 0
2x (x – 12) + 25 (x – 12) = 0
i.e., (x – 12)(2x + 25) = 0
So, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = – 12.5. Since x is the breadth
of the hall, it cannot be negative.
Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 = 25 m.

twice the number of articles produced on that day. If the total cost of production on that
day was ` 90, find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article.
4.4 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square
In the previous section, you have learnt one method of obtaining the roots of a quadratic
equation. In this section, we shall study another method.
Consider the following situation:
The product of Sunita’s age (in years) two years ago and her age four years
from now is one more than twice her present age. What is her present age?
To answer this, let her present age (in years) be x. Then the product of her ages
two years ago and four years from now is (x – 2)(x + 4).
2015-16 (11-11-2014)
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 77
Therefore, (x – 2)(x + 4) = 2x + 1
i.e., x2
 + 2x – 8 = 2x + 1
i.e., x2
 – 9 = 0
So, Sunita’s present age satisfies the quadratic equation x2
 – 9 = 0.
We can write this as x2
 = 9. Taking square roots, we get x = 3 or x = – 3. Since
the age is a positive number, x = 3.
So, Sunita’s present age is 3 years.
Now consider the quadratic equation (x + 2)2
 – 9 = 0. To solve it, we can write
it as (x + 2)2
 = 9. Taking square roots, we get x + 2 = 3 or x + 2 = – 3.
Therefore, x = 1 or x = –5
So, the roots of the equation (x + 2) 2
 – 9 = 0 are 1 and – 5.
In both the examples above, the term containing x is completely inside a square,
and we found the roots easily by taking the square roots. But, what happens if we are
asked to solve the equation x2
 + 4x – 5 = 0? We would probably apply factorisation to
do so, unless we realise (somehow!) that x2
 + 4x – 5 = (x + 2)2
 – 9.
So, solving x2 + 4x – 5 = 0 is equivalent to solving (x + 2) 2
 – 9 = 0, which we have
seen is very quick to do. In fact, we can convert any quadratic equation to the form
(x + a)
2
 – b2
 = 0 and then we can easily find its roots. Let us see if this is possible.
Look at Fig. 4.2.
In this figure, we can see how x2
 + 4x is being converted to (x + 2) 2
 – 4.
Fig. 4.2

The process is as follows:

 + 4x =(x2

2 x
= x2
 + 2x + 2x
= (x + 2) x + 2 × x
= (x + 2) x + 2 × x + 2 × 2 – 2 × 2
= (x + 2) x + (x + 2) × 2 – 2 × 2
= (x + 2) (x + 2) – 22
= (x + 2)2 – 4
So, x2
 + 4x – 5 = (x + 2)2
 – 4 – 5 = (x + 2)2 – 9
So, x2
 + 4x – 5 = 0 can be written as (x + 2)2
 – 9 = 0 by this process of completing
the square. This is known as the method of completing the square.
In brief, this can be shown as follows:

 is not
a perfect square. So, we multiply the equation throughout by 3 to get
9x2
 – 15x + 6 = 0

Therefore, the roots of the given equation are 1 and

Now, you have seen several examples of the use of the method of completing

This formula for finding the roots of a quadratic equation is known as the
quadratic formula.
Let us consider some examples for illustrating the use of the quadratic formula.
Example 10 : Solve Q. 2(i) of Exercise 4.1 by using the quadratic formula.
Solution : Let the breadth of the plot be x metres. Then the length is (2x + 1) metres.
Then we are given that x(2x + 1) = 528, i.e., 2x2
 + x – 528 = 0.
This is of the form ax 2
 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = 1, c = – 528.
So, the quadratic formula gives us the solution as
x =

i.e., x =

i.e., x = 16 or x =

Since x cannot be negative, being a dimension, the breadth of the plot is
16 metres and hence, the length of the plot is 33m.
You should verify that these values satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Example 11 : Find two consecutive odd positive integers, sum of whose squares
is 290.
Solution : Let the smaller of the two consecutive odd positive integers be x. Then, the
second integer will be x + 2. According to the question,
x2
 + (x + 2)2
 = 290
i.e., x2
 + x2
 + 4x + 4 = 290
i.e., 2x2
 + 4x – 286 = 0
i.e., x2 + 2x – 143 = 0
which is a quadratic equation in x.
Using the quadratic formula, we get
x =
2 4 572 2 576 2 24
2 22
     
i.e., x = 11 or x = – 13
But x is given to be an odd positive integer. Therefore, x ≠ – 13, x = 11.
Thus, the two consecutive odd integers are 11 and 13.
Check : 112
 + 132 = 121 + 169 = 290.
Example 12 : A rectangular park is to be designed whose breadth is 3 m less than its
length. Its area is to be 4 square metres more than the area of a park that has already
been made in the shape of an isosceles triangle with its base as the breadth of the
rectangular park and of altitude 12 m (see Fig. 4.3). Find its length and breadth.
Solution : Let the breadth of the rectangular park be x m.
So, its length = (x + 3) m.
Therefore, the area of the rectangular park = x(x + 3) m2
 = (x
2
 + 3x) m2
.
Now, base of the isosceles triangle = x m.
Therefore, its area =
1
2
 × x × 12 = 6 x m2
.
According to our requirements,
x2
 + 3x =6x + 4
i.e., x2
 – 3x – 4 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get Fig. 4.3

But x ≠ – 1 (Why?). Therefore, x = 4.
So, the breadth of the park = 4m and its length will be 7m.
Verification : Area of rectangular park = 28 m2

area of triangular park = 24 m2

Example 13 : Find the roots of the following quadratic equations, if they exist, using
the quadratic formula:
(i) 3x2
 – 5x + 2 = 0 (ii) x2
 + 4x + 5 = 0 (iii) 2x2
 – 2 2 x + 1 = 0
Solution :
(i) 3x2 – 5x + 2 = 0. Here, a = 3, b = – 5, c = 2. So, b2

Therefore, x =

So, the roots are

(ii) x2

Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, therefore 2 b ac  4 will
not have any real value.
So, there are no real roots for the given equation.
(iii) 2x2
 – 2 2 x + 1 = 0. Here, a = 2, b = 2 2 , c = 1.
So, b2

Here, a = 1, b = – 3, c = 1
So, b2

So, the given equation reduces to 3x2 – 6x + 2 = 0, which is a quadratic equation.
Here, a = 3, b = – 6, c = 2. So, b2

Example 15 : A motor boat whose speed is 18 km/h in still water takes 1 hour more
to go 24 km upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of

Solution : Let the speed of the stream be x km/h.
Therefore, the speed of the boat upstream = (18 – x) km/h and the speed of the boat
downstream = (18 + x) km/h.
The time taken to go upstream =

i.e., 24(18 + x) – 24(18 – x) = (18 – x) (18 + x)

So, the roots of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are both 2
b
a
 
Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 has two equal
real roots in this case.
If b2
 – 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b2
 – 4ac. Therefore,
there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.
Since b2
 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2
 + bx + c = 0 has
real roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.
So, a quadratic equation ax2
 + bx + c = 0 has
(i) two distinct real roots, if b2
 – 4ac > 0,
(ii) two equal real roots, if b2
 – 4ac = 0,
(iii) no real roots, if b2
 – 4ac < 0.
Let us consider some examples.
Example 16 : Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2
 – 4x + 3 = 0, and
hence find the nature of its roots.
Solution : The given equation is of the form ax 2
 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and
c = 3. Therefore, the discriminant
b2 – 4ac = (– 4)2 – (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 – 24 = – 8 < 0
So, the given equation has no real roots.
Example 17 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park
of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two
diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to
do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?
Solution : Let us first draw the diagram
(see Fig. 4.4).
Let P be the required location of the
pole. Let the distance of the pole from the
gate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the
difference of the distances of the pole from
the two gates = AP – BP (or, BP – AP) =
7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m.
Fig. 4.4
2015-16 (11-11-2014)
90 MATHEMATICS
Now, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,
∠APB = 90° (Why?)
Therefore, AP2 + PB2 = AB2 (By Pythagoras theorem)
i.e., (x + 7)2 + x2 = 132
i.e., x2
 + 14x + 49 + x2
 = 169
i.e., 2x2
 + 14x – 120 = 0
So, the distance ‘x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
x2
 + 7x – 60 = 0
So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this
is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is
b2
 – 4ac = 72
 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0.
So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the
pole on the boundary of the park.
Solving the quadratic equation x2
 + 7x – 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get
x =
7 289
2
 
 =
7 17
2
 
Therefore, x = 5 or – 12.
Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive.
Therefore, x = – 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5.
Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m
from the gate B and 12m from the gate A.
Example 18 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x2
 – 2x +

3 = 0 and hence find
the nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.

In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax 2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real
numbers and a ≠ 0.
2. A real number α is said to be a root of the quadratic equation ax2
