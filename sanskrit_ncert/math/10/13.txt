13.1 Introduction
From Class IX, you are familiar with some of the solids like cuboid, cone, cylinder, and
sphere (see Fig. 13.1). You have also learnt how to find their surface areas and volumes.
Fig. 13.1
In our day-to-day life, we come across a number of solids made up of combinations
of two or more of the basic solids as shown above.
You must have seen a truck with a
container fitted on its back (see Fig. 13.2),
carrying oil or water from one place to
another. Is it in the shape of any of the four
basic solids mentioned above? You may
guess that it is made of a cylinder with two
hemispheres as its ends.

Again, you may have seen an object like the
one in Fig. 13.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right!
You would have used one in your science laboratory.
This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a
hemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have
seen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments
made up of a combination of solids mentioned above.
If for some reason you wanted to find the
surface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such
objects, how would you do it? We cannot classify
these under any of the solids you have already studied.
In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such
objects.
13.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids
Let us consider the container seen in Fig. 13.2. How do we find the surface area of
such a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if
we can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that
this solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would
look like what we have in Fig. 13.4, after we put the pieces all together.
Fig. 13.4
If we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see
only the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder.
So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface
areas of each of the individual parts. This gives,
TSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder
 + CSA of other hemisphere
where TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’
respectively.
Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting
together a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going
through.
Fig. 13.3
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 241
First, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together.
Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the
hemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown
in Fig. 13.5.
Fig. 13.5
At the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if
we want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,
what would we need to know? We would need to know the surface area of the toy,
which consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone.
So, we can say:
Total surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now, let us consider some examples.
Example 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his
birthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on
it. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is
shaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere
(see Fig 13.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and
the diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he
has to colour. (Take π =
22
7 )
Solution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 13.5. So, we
can conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :
TSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone
Now, the curved surface area of the hemisphere =

Also, the height of the cone = height of the top – height (radius) of the hemispherical part

So, the slant height of the cone (l ) =

Therefore, CSA of cone = πrl =

You may note that ‘total surface area of the top’ is not the sum of the total
surface areas of the cone and hemisphere.
Example 2 : The decorative block shown
in Fig. 13.7 is made of two solids — a cube
and a hemisphere. The base of the block is a
cube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere
fixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm.
Find the total surface area of the block.
(Take π =
22
7 )
Solution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 × (edge)2 = 6 × 5 × 5 cm2
 = 150 cm2.
Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the
surface area.
So, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube – base area of hemisphere
+ CSA of hemisphere
= 150 – πr2

Example 3 : A wooden toy rocket is in the
shape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as
shown in Fig. 13.8. The height of the entire
rocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical
part is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion
has a diameter of 5 cm, while the base
diameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If
the conical portion is to be painted orange
and the cylindrical portion yellow, find the
area of the rocket painted with each of these
colours. (Take π = 3.14)
Solution : Denote radius of cone by r, slant
height of cone by l, height of cone by h, radius
of cylinder by r′ and height of cylinder by h′.
Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r′ = 1.5 cm,
h′ = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and
l = 2 2 r h  = 2 2 2.5 6 cm  = 6.5 cm
Here, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but
the base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the
cone (a ring) is to be painted.
So, the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone
 – base area of the cylinder

= π[20.25] cm2

= 2πr′h′ + π(r′)

= πr′ (2h′ + r′)
= (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm2

Example 4 : Mayank made a bird-bath for his garden
in the shape of a cylinder with a hemispherical
depression at one end (see Fig. 13.9). The height of
the cylinder is 1.45 m and its radius is 30 cm. Find the
toal surface area of the bird-bath. (Take π =

Solution : Let h be height of the cylinder, and r the
common radius of the cylinder and hemisphere. Then,
the total surface area of the bird-bath = CSA of cylinder + CSA of hemisphere

surface area of the article.
13.3 Volume of a Combination of Solids
In the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made
up of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their
volumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the
surface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared
in the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate
the volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be
the sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below.
Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in
a shed which is in the shape of a cuboid
surmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig.
13.12). If the base of the shed is of
dimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height of
the cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume
of air that the shed can hold. Further,
suppose the machinery in the shed
occupies a total space of 300 m3
, and
there are 20 workers, each of whom
occupy about 0.08 m3
 space on an
average. Then, how much air is in the
shed? (Take π =
22
7 )
Fig. 13.12
Fig. 13.11
246 MATHEMATICS
Solution : The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)
is given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken
together.
Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m, respectively.
Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m.
So, the required volume = volume of the cuboid +

2 7 22
           = 1128.75 m3
Next, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3
And the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3 = 1.6 m3
Therefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers
= 1128.75 – (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m3
Example 6 : A juice seller was serving his
customers using glasses as shown in Fig. 13.13.
The inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was
5 cm, but the bottom of the glass had a
hemispherical raised portion which reduced the
capacity of the glass. If the height of a glass
was 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of the
glass and its actual capacity. (Use π = 3.14.)
Solution : Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,
the apparent capacity of the glass = πr2h
= 3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3
 = 196.25 cm3
But the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the
base of the glass.
i.e., it is less by
2
3 πr3
 =
2 3 3.14 2.5 2.5 2.5 cm
3
  = 32.71 cm3
So, the actual capacity of the glass = apparent capacity of glass – volume of the
hemisphere

Example 7 : A solid toy is in the form of a
hemisphere surmounted by a right circular cone. The
height of the cone is 2 cm and the diameter of the
base is 4 cm. Determine the volume of the toy. If a
right circular cylinder circumscribes the toy, find the
difference of the volumes of the cylinder and the toy.
(Take π = 3.14)
Solution : Let BPC be the hemisphere and ABC be the cone standing on the base
of the hemisphere (see Fig. 13.14). The radius BO of the hemisphere (as well as
of the cone) =
1
2

So, volume of the toy =

Now, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of
the base of the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is
EH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm
So, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy
 = (3.14 × 22
 × 4 – 25.12) cm3
 = 25.12 cm3
Hence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3
.

measurements, and π = 3.14.
13.4 Conversion of Solid from One Shape to Another
We are sure you would have seen candles.
Generally, they are in the shape of a cylinder.
You may have also seen some candles
shaped like an animal (see Fig. 13.17).

SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 249
How are they made? If you want a candle of any special shape, you will have to
heat the wax in a metal container till it becomes completely liquid. Then you will have to
pour it into another container which has the special shape that you want. For example,
take a candle in the shape of a solid cylinder, melt it and pour whole of the molten wax
into another container shaped like a rabbit. On cooling, you will obtain a candle in the
shape of the rabbit. The volume of the new candle will be the same as the volume of
the earlier candle. This is what we
have to remember when we come
across objects which are converted
from one shape to another, or when
a liquid which originally filled one
container of a particular shape is
poured into another container of a
different shape or size, as you see in
Fig 13.18.
To understand what has been discussed, let us consider some examples.
Example 8: A cone of height 24 cm and radius of base 6 cm is made up of modelling
clay. A child reshapes it in the form of a sphere. Find the radius of the sphere.

i.e., r3

Therefore, the radius of the sphere is 6 cm.
Example 9 : Selvi’s house has an overhead tank in the shape of a cylinder. This
is filled by pumping water from a sump (an underground tank) which is in the
shape of a cuboid. The sump has dimensions 1.57 m × 1.44 m × 95cm. The
overhead tank has its radius 60 cm and height 95 cm. Find the height of the water
left in the sump after the overhead tank has been completely filled with water
from the sump which had been full. Compare the capacity of the tank with that of
the sump. (Use π = 3.14)
Fig. 13.18
250 MATHEMATICS
Solution : The volume of water in the overhead tank equals the volume of the water
removed from the sump.
Now, the volume of water in the overhead tank (cylinder) = πr2h
= 3.14 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.95 m3
The volume of water in the sump when full = l × b × h = 1.57 × 1.44 × 0.95 m3
The volume of water left in the sump after filling the tank
= [(1.57 × 1.44 × 0.95) – (3.14 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.95)] m3 = (1.57 × 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.95 × 2) m3
So, the height of the water left in the sump = volume of water left in the sump

Therefore, the capacity of the tank is half the capacity of the sump.

The length of the new wire of the same volume = 18 m = 1800 cm

Therefore, π × r2 × 1800 = 2π
i.e., r2

13.5 Frustum of a Cone
In Section 13.2, we observed objects that are formed when two basic solids were
joined together. Let us now do something different. We will take a right circular cone
and remove a portion of it. There are so many ways
in which we can do this. But one particular case that
we are interested in is the removal of a smaller right
circular cone by cutting the given cone by a plane
parallel to its base. You must have observed that the
glasses (tumblers), in general, used for drinking water, are of this shape. (See Fig. 13.19)
Activity 1 : Take some clay, or any other such material (like plasticine, etc.) and form
a cone. Cut it with a knife parallel to its base. Remove the smaller cone. What are you
left with?You are left with a solid called a frustum of the cone. You can see that this
has two circular ends with different radii.
So, given a cone, when we slice (or cut) through it with a plane parallel to its base
(see Fig. 13.20) and remove the cone that is formed on one side of that plane, the part
that is now left over on the other side of the plane is called a frustum* of the cone.

How can we find the surface area and volume of a frustum of a cone? Let
us explain it through an example.
Example 12 : The radii of the ends of a frustum
of a cone 45 cm high are 28 cm and 7 cm
(see Fig. 13.21). Find its volume, the curved
surface area and the total suface area
(Take π =

Solution : The frustum can be viewed as a difference of two right circular cones OAB and
OCD (see Fig. 13.21). Let the height (in cm)
of the cone OAB be h1 and its slant height l 1,
i.e., OP = h1
 and OA = OB = l
1
. Let h2 be the
height of cone OCD and l
2 its slant height.
We have : r1
 = 28 cm, r2 = 7 cm
and the height of frustum (h) = 45 cm. Also,
h1
 = 45 + h2 (1)
We first need to determine the respective heights h1 and h2 of the cone OAB
and OCD.
Since the triangles OPB and OQD are similar (Why?), we have

From (1) and (2), we get h2 = 15 and h1
 = 60.

Let h be the height, l the slant height and r1
 and r2
 the radii of the ends
(r1 > r2) of the frustum of a cone. Then we can directly find the volume, the
curved surace area and the total surface area of frustum by using the formulae
given below :
(i) Volume of the frustum of the cone = 2 2

(ii) the curved surface area of the frustum of the cone = π(r1 + r2)l

Let us apply these formulae in some examples.
Example 13 : Hanumappa and his wife Gangamma are
busy making jaggery out of sugarcane juice. They have
processed the sugarcane juice to make the molasses,
which is poured into moulds in the shape of a frustum of
a cone having the diameters of its two circular faces as
30 cm and 35 cm and the vertical height of the mould is
14 cm (see Fig. 13.22). If each cm3

mass about 1.2 g, find the mass of the molasses that can
be poured into each mould. 22 Take

It is given that 1 cm3

be poured into each mould = (11641.7 × 1.2) g
= 13970.04 g = 13.97 kg = 14 kg (approx.)

Example 14 : An open metal bucket is in the
shape of a frustum of a cone, mounted on a
hollow cylindrical base made of the same metallic sheet (see Fig. 13.23). The diameters of
the two circular ends of the bucket are 45 cm
and 25 cm, the total vertical height of the bucket
is 40 cm and that of the cylindrical base is
6 cm. Find the area of the metallic sheet used
to make the bucket, where we do not take into
account the handle of the bucket. Also, find
the volume of water the bucket can hold.
22 Take

 .
Solution : The total height of the bucket = 40 cm, which includes the height of the
base. So, the height of the frustum of the cone = (40 – 6) cm = 34 cm.
Therefore, the slant height of the frustum, l = 2 2
1 2 h rr ( ) ,
where r

So, l = 2 2 34 (22.5 12.5)   cm

The area of metallic sheet used = curved surface area of frustum of cone
