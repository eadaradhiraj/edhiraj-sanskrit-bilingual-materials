CHAPTER 15
PROBABILITY
It is remarkable that a science, which began with the consideration of
games of chance, should be elevated to the rank of the most important
subject of human knowledge. —Pierre Simon Laplace
15.1 Introduction
In everyday life, we come across statements such as
(1) It will probably rain today.
(2) I doubt that he will pass the test.
(3) Most probably, Kavita will stand first in the annual examination.
(4) Chances are high that the prices of diesel will go up.
(5) There is a 50-50 chance of India winning a toss in today’s match.
The words ‘probably’, ‘doubt’, ‘most probably’, ‘chances’, etc., used in the
statements above involve an element of uncertainty. For example, in (1), ‘probably
rain’ will mean it may rain or may not rain today. We are predicting rain today based
on our past experience when it rained under similar conditions. Similar predictions are
also made in other cases listed in (2) to (5).
The uncertainty of ‘probably’ etc can be measured numerically by means of
‘probability’ in many cases.
Though probability started with gambling, it has been used extensively in the fields
of Physical Sciences, Commerce, Biological Sciences, Medical Sciences, Weather
Forecasting, etc.

15.2 Probability – an Experimental Approach
In earlier classes, you have had a glimpse of probability when you performed
experiments like tossing of coins, throwing of dice, etc., and observed their outcomes.
You will now learn to measure the chance of occurrence of a particular outcome in an
experiment.
The concept of probability developed in a very
strange manner. In 1654, a gambler Chevalier
de Mere, approached the well-known 17th
century French philosopher and mathematician
Blaise Pascal regarding certain dice problems.
Pascal became interested in these problems,
studied them and discussed them with another
French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat. Both
Pascal and Fermat solved the problems
independently. This work was the beginning
of Probability Theory.
The first book on the subject was written by the Italian mathematician, J.Cardan
(1501–1576). The title of the book was ‘Book on Games of Chance’ (Liber de Ludo
Aleae), published in 1663. Notable contributions were also made by mathematicians
J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), P. Laplace (1749–1827), A.A. Markov (1856–1922) and A.N.
Kolmogorov (born 1903).
Activity 1 : (i) Take any coin, toss it ten times and note down the number of times a
head and a tail come up. Record your observations in the form of the following table
Table 15.1

the coin is tossed head comes up tail comes up

Write down the values of the following fractions:
Number of times a head comes up
Total number of times the coin is tossed
and
Number of times a tail comes up
Total number of times the coin is tossed

(ii) Toss the coin twenty times and in the same way record your observations as
above. Again find the values of the fractions given above for this collection of
observations.
(iii) Repeat the same experiment by increasing the number of tosses and record
the number of heads and tails. Then find the values of the corresponding
fractions.
You will find that as the number of tosses gets larger, the values of the fractions
come closer to 0.5. To record what happens in more and more tosses, the following
group activity can also be performed:
Acitivity 2 : Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3 students. Let a student in each
group toss a coin 15 times. Another student in each group should record the observations
regarding heads and tails. [Note that coins of the same denomination should be used in
all the groups. It will be treated as if only one coin has been tossed by all the groups.]
Now, on the blackboard, make a table like Table 15.2. First, Group 1 can write
down its observations and calculate the resulting fractions. Then Group 2 can write
down its observations, but will calculate the fractions for the combined data of Groups
1 and 2, and so on. (We may call these fractions as cumulative fractions.) We have
noted the first three rows based on the observations given by one class of students.
Table 15.2

What do you observe in the table? You will find that as the total number of tosses
of the coin increases, the values of the fractions in Columns (4) and (5) come nearer
and nearer to 0.5.
Activity 3 : (i) Throw a die* 20 times and note down the number of times the numbers
*A die is a well balanced cube with its six faces marked with numbers from 1 to 6, one number
on one face. Sometimes dots appear in place of numbers.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 come up. Record your observations in the form of a table, as in Table 15.3:
Table 15.3
Number of times a die is thrown Number of times these scores turn up

Find the values of the following fractions:
Number of times 1 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
Number of times 2 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
M
M
Number of times 6 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
(ii) Now throw the die 40 times, record the observations and calculate the fractions
as done in (i).
As the number of throws of the die increases, you will find that the value of each
fraction calculated in (i) and (ii) comes closer and closer to 1
6
.
To see this, you could perform a group activity, as done in Activity 2. Divide the
students in your class, into small groups. One student in each group should throw a die
ten times. Observations should be noted and cumulative fractions should be calculated.
The values of the fractions for the number 1 can be recorded in Table 15.4. This
table can be extended to write down fractions for the other numbers also or other
tables of the same kind can be created for the other numbers.

The dice used in all the groups should be almost the same in size and appearence.

Column (3) move closer and closer to 1

Now increase the number of tosses (as in Activitiy 2). You will find that the more
the number of tosses, the closer are the values of A, B and C to 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25,
respectively.
In Activity 1, each toss of a coin is called a trial. Similarly in Activity 3, each
throw of a die is a trial, and each simultaneous toss of two coins in Activity 4 is also a
trial.
So, a trial is an action which results in one or several outcomes. The possible
outcomes in Activity 1 were Head and Tail; whereas in Activity 3, the possible outcomes
were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
In Activity 1, the getting of a head in a particular throw is an event with outcome
‘head’. Similarly, getting a tail is an event with outcome ‘tail’. In Activity 2, the
getting of a particular number, say 1, is an event with outcome 1.
If our experiment was to throw the die for getting an even number, then the event
would consist of three outcomes, namely, 2, 4 and 6.
So, an event for an experiment is the collection of some outcomes of the experiment.
In Class X, you will study a more formal definition of an event.
So, can you now tell what the events are in Activity 4?
With this background, let us now see what probability is. Based on what we directly
observe as the outcomes of our trials, we find the experimental or empirical probability.
Let n be the total number of trials. The empirical probability P(E) of an event E
happening, is given by
P(E) =
Number of trials in which the event happened
The total number of trials
In this chapter, we shall be finding the empirical probability, though we will write
‘probability’ for convenience.
Let us consider some examples.
To start with let us go back to Activity 2, and Table 15.2. In Column (4) of this
table, what is the fraction that you calculated? Nothing, but it is the empirical probability
of getting a head. Note that this probability kept changing depending on the number of
trials and the number of heads obtained in these trials. Similarly, the empirical probability
of getting a tail is obtained in Column (5) of Table 15.2. This is
12
15 to start with, then
it is
2
3 , then
28
45 , and so on.
So, the empirical probability depends on the number of trials undertaken, and the
number of times the outcomes you are looking for coming up in these trials.

Activity 5 : Before going further, look at the tables you drew up while doing
Activity 3. Find the probabilities of getting a 3 when throwing a die a certain number
of times. Also, show how it changes as the number of trials increases.
Now let us consider some other examples.
Example 1 : A coin is tossed 1000 times with the following frequencies:
Head : 455, Tail : 545
Compute the probability for each event.
Solution : Since the coin is tossed 1000 times, the total number of trials is 1000. Let us
call the events of getting a head and of getting a tail as E and F, respectively. Then, the
number of times E happens, i.e., the number of times a head come up, is 455.
So, the probability of E =
Number of heads
Total number of trials
i.e., P (E) =
455
1000
 = 0.455
Similarly, the probability of the event of getting a tail =
Number of tails
Total number of trials
i.e., P(F) =
545
1000
 = 0.545
Note that in the example above, P(E) + P(F) = 0.455 + 0.545 = 1, and E and F are
the only two possible outcomes of each trial.
Example 2 : Two coins are tossed simultaneously 500 times, and we get
Two heads : 105 times
One head : 275 times
No head : 120 times
Find the probability of occurrence of each of these events.
Solution : Let us denote the events of getting two heads, one head and no head by E1
,
E2
 and E3
, respectively. So,
P(E1
) =
105
500
 = 0.21
P(E2
) =
275
500
 = 0.55
P(E3
) =
120
500
 = 0.24

Observe that P(E1
) + P(E2
) + P(E3
) = 1. Also E1, E2 and E3 cover all the outcomes
of a trial.
Example 3 : A die is thrown 1000 times with the frequencies for the outcomes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 as given in the following table :
Table 15.6
Outcome 123456
Frequency 179 150 157 149 175 190
Find the probability of getting each outcome.
Solution : Let Ei
 denote the event of getting the outcome i, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Then
Probability of the outcome 1 = P(E1
) = Frequency of 1
Total number of times the die is thrown
= 179
1000
 = 0.179
Similarly, P(E2) =
150
1000 = 0.15, P(E3) =
157
1000 = 0.157,
P(E4) =
149
1000 = 0.149, P(E5) =
175
1000
 = 0.175
and P(E6
) =
190
1000
 = 0.19.
Note that P(E1
) + P(E2
) + P(E3
) + P(E4
) + P(E5) + P(E6
) = 1
Also note that:
(i) The probability of each event lies between 0 and 1.
(ii) The sum of all the probabilities is 1.
(iii) E1
, E2
, . . ., E6
 cover all the possible outcomes of a trial.
Example 4 : On one page of a telephone directory, there were 200 telephone numbers.
The frequency distribution of their unit place digit (for example, in the number 25828573,
the unit place digit is 3) is given in Table 15.7 :

Table 15.7
Digit 0123456789
Frequency 22 26 22 22 20 10 14 28 16 20
Without looking at the page, the pencil is placed on one of these numbers, i.e., the
number is chosen at random. What is the probability that the digit in its unit place is 6?
Solution : The probability of digit 6 being in the unit place
= Frequency of 6
Total number of selected telephone numbers
= 14
200
 = 0.07
You can similarly obtain the empirical probabilities of the occurrence of the numbers
having the other digits in the unit place.
Example 5 : The record of a weather station shows that out of the past 250 consecutive
days, its weather forecasts were correct 175 times.
(i) What is the probability that on a given day it was correct?
(ii) What is the probability that it was not correct on a given day?
Solution : The total number of days for which the record is available = 250
(i) P(the forecast was correct on a given day)
= Number of days when the forecast was correct
Total number of days for which the record is available
= 175
250
 = 0.7
(ii) The number of days when the forecast was not correct = 250 – 175 = 75
So, P(the forecast was not correct on a given day) =
75
250 = 0.3
Notice that:
P(forecast was correct on a given day) + P(forecast was not correct on a given day)
= 0.7 + 0.3 = 1

Example 6 : A tyre manufacturing company kept a record of the distance covered
before a tyre needed to be replaced. The table shows the results of 1000 cases.
Table 15.8
Distance (in km) less than 4000 4000 to 9000 9001 to 14000 more than 14000
Frequency 20 210 325 445
If you buy a tyre of this company, what is the probability that :
(i) it will need to be replaced before it has covered 4000 km?
(ii) it will last more than 9000 km?
(iii) it will need to be replaced after it has covered somewhere between 4000 km
and 14000 km?
Solution : (i) The total number of trials = 1000.
The frequency of a tyre that needs to be replaced before it covers 4000 km is 20.
So, P(tyre to be replaced before it covers 4000 km) =
20
1000
 = 0.02
(ii) The frequency of a tyre that will last more than 9000 km is 325 + 445 = 770
So, P(tyre will last more than 9000 km) =
770
1000
 = 0.77
(iii) The frequency of a tyre that requires replacement between 4000 km and
14000 km is 210 + 325 = 535.
So, P(tyre requiring replacement between 4000 km and 14000 km) =
535
1000
 = 0.535

Solution : The total number of unit tests held is 5.
The number of unit tests in which the student obtained more than 70% marks is 3.
So, P(scoring more than 70% marks) =

Example 8 : An insurance company selected 2000 drivers at random (i.e., without
any preference of one driver over another) in a particular city to find a relationship
between age and accidents. The data obtained are given in the following table:
Table 15.10
 Age of drivers Accidents in one year
 (in years) 0 1 2 3 over 3

30 - 50 505 125 60 22 18
Above 50 360 45 35 15 9
Find the probabilities of the following events for a driver chosen at random from the
city:
(i) being 18-29 years of age and having exactly 3 accidents in one year.
(ii) being 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents in a year.
(iii) having no accidents in one year.
Solution : Total number of drivers = 2000.
(i) The number of drivers who are 18-29 years old and have exactly 3 accidents
in one year is 61.
So, P (driver is 18-29 years old with exactly 3 accidents) =
61
2000
 = 0.0305 ≈ 0.031
(ii) The number of drivers 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents
in one year = 125 + 60 + 22 + 18 = 225
So, P(driver is 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents)
= 225
2000
 = 0.1125 ≈ 0.113
(iii) The number of drivers having no accidents in one year = 440 + 505 + 360

Example 9 : Consider the frequency distribution table (Table 14.3, Example 4,
Chapter 14), which gives the weights of 38 students of a class.
(i) Find the probability that the weight of a student in the class lies in the interval
46-50 kg.
(ii) Give two events in this context, one having probability 0 and the other having
probability 1.
Solution : (i) The total number of students is 38, and the number of students with
weight in the interval 46 - 50 kg is 3.
So, P(weight of a student is in the interval 46 - 50 kg) =
3
38
 = 0.079
(ii) For instance, consider the event that a student weighs 30 kg. Since no student has
this weight, the probability of occurrence of this event is 0. Similarly, the probability
of a student weighing more than 30 kg is
38
38
 = 1.
Example 10 : Fifty seeds were selected at random from each of 5 bags of seeds, and
were kept under standardised conditions favourable to germination. After 20 days, the
number of seeds which had germinated in each collection were counted and recorded
as follows:

What is the probability of germination of
(i) more than 40 seeds in a bag?
(ii) 49 seeds in a bag?
(iii) more that 35 seeds in a bag?
Solution : Total number of bags is 5.
(i) Number of bags in which more than 40 seeds germinated out of 50 seeds is 3.
P(germination of more than 40 seeds in a bag) = 5

(ii) False. This contradicts Axiom 5.1.
(iii) True. (Postulate 2)
(iv) True. If you superimpose the region bounded by one circle on the other, then they
coincide. So, their centres and boundaries coincide. Therefore, their radii will
coincide.
(v) True. The first axiom of Euclid.
3. There are several undefined terms which the student should list. They are consistent,
because they deal with two different situations — (i) says that given two points A and
B, there is a point C lying on the line in between them; (ii) says that given A and B, you
can take C not lying on the line through A and B.
These ‘postulates’ do not follow from Euclid’s postulates. However, they follow from
Axiom 5.1.
4. AC = BC
So, AC + AC = BC + AC (Equals are added to equals)
i.e., 2AC = AB (BC + AC coincides with AB)
Therefore, AC =

AC = AB + BC (Point B lies between A and C) (2)
BD = BC + CD (Point C lies between B and D) (3)
Substituting (2) and (3) in (1), you get
AB + BC = BC + CD
So, AB = CD (Subtracting equals from equals)

EXERCISE 5.2
1. Any formulation the student gives should be discussed in the class for its validity.
2. If a straight line l falls on two straight lines m and n such that sum of the interior angles
on one side of l is two right angles, then by Euclid’s fifth postulate the line will not meet
on this side of l. Next, you know that the sum of the interior angles on the other side of
line l will also be two right angles. Therefore, they will not meet on the other side also.
So, the lines m and n never meet and are, therefore, parallel.

2. Student’s own answer.
3. Let x and y be two odd numbers. Then x = 2m +1 for some natural number m and
y = 2n + 1 for some natural number n.
x + y = 2 (m + n + 1). Therefore, x + y is divisible by 2 and is even.
4. See Q.3. xy = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 2 (2mn + m + n) + 1.
Therefore, x y is not divisible by 2, and so it is odd.
5. Let 2n, 2n + 2 and 2n + 4 be three consecutive even numbers. Then their sum is
6(n + 1), which is divisible by 6.
7. (i) Let your original number be n. Then we are doing the following operations:
n → 2n → 2 n + 9 → 2 n + 9 + n = 3n + 9 →

n 
 = n + 3 →n + 3 + 4 = n + 7 →
n + 7 – n = 7.
(ii) Note that 7 × 11 × 13 = 1001. Take any three digit number say, abc. Then
abc × 1001 = abcabc. Therefore, the six digit number abcabc is divisible by 7, 11
and 13.

EXERCISE A2.1
1. Step 1: Formulation :
The relevant factors are the time period for hiring a computer, and the two costs given
to us. We assume that there is no significant change in the cost of purchasing or
hiring the computer. So, we treat any such change as irrelevant. We also treat all
brands and generations of computers as the same, i.e. these differences are also
irrelevant.
The expense of hiring the computer for x months is ` 2000x. If this becomes more than
the cost of purchasing a computer, we will be better off buying a computer. So, the
equation is
2000 x = 25000 (1)
Step 2 : Solution : Solving (1), x =
25000
2000
 = 12.5
Step 3 : Interpretation : Since the cost of hiring a computer becomes more after 12.5
months, it is cheaper to buy a computer, if you have to use it for more than 12 months.
2. Step1 : Formulation : We will assume that cars travel at a constant speed. So, any
change of speed will be treated as irrelevant. If the cars meet after x hours, the first car
would have travelled a distance of 40x km from A and the second car would have
travelled 30x km, so that it will be at a distance of (100 – 30x) km from A. So the
equation will be 40x = 100 – 30x, i.e., 70x = 100.
Step 2 : Solution : Solving the equation, we get x = 100
70 .
Step 3 : Interpretation : 100
70 is approximately 1.4 hours. So, the cars will meet after
1.4 hours.
3. Step1 : Formulation : The speed at which the moon orbits the earth is
Length of the orbit
Time taken .
Step 2 : Solution : Since the orbit is nearly circular, the length is 2 × π × 384000 km
= 2411520 km
The moon takes 24 hours to complete one orbit.
So, speed =
2411520
24
= 100480 km/hour.
Step 3 : Interpretation : The speed is 100480 km/h.
4. Formulation : An assumption is that the difference in the bill is only because of using
the water heater.

350 MATHEMATICS
Let the average number of hours for which the water heater is used = x
Difference per month due to using water heater = ` 1240 – ` 1000 = ` 240
Cost of using water heater for one hour = ` 8
So, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = 8 × 30 × x
Also, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = Difference in bill due to using
water heater
So, 240x = 240
Solution : From this equation, we get x = 1.
Interpretation : Since x = 1, the water heater is used for an average of 1 hour in a day.
