CHAPTER 14
STATISTICS
14.1 Introduction
Everyday we come across a lot of information in the form of facts, numerical figures,
tables, graphs, etc. These are provided by newspapers, televisions, magazines and
other means of communication. These may relate to cricket batting or bowling averages,
profits of a company, temperatures of cities, expenditures in various sectors of a five
year plan, polling results, and so on. These facts or figures, which are numerical or
otherwise, collected with a definite purpose are called data. Data is the plural form of
the Latin word datum. Of course, the word ‘data’ is not new for you. You have
studied about data and data handling in earlier classes.
Our world is becoming more and more information oriented. Every part of our
lives utilises data in one form or the other. So, it becomes essential for us to know how
to extract meaningful information from such data. This extraction of meaningful
information is studied in a branch of mathematics called Statistics.
The word ‘statistics’ appears to have been derived from the Latin word ‘status’
meaning ‘a (political) state’. In its origin, statistics was simply the collection of data on
different aspects of the life of people, useful to the State. Over the period of time,
however, its scope broadened and statistics began to concern itself not only with the
collection and presentation of data but also with the interpretation and drawing of
inferences from the data. Statistics deals with collection, organisation, analysis and
interpretation of data. The word ‘statistics’ has different meanings in different contexts.
Let us observe the following sentences:
1. May I have the latest copy of ‘Educational Statistics of India’.
2. I like to study ‘Statistics’ because it is used in day-to-day life.
In the first sentence, statistics is used in a plural sense, meaning numerical data. These
may include a number of educational institutions of India, literacy rates of various
STATISTICS 239

states, etc. In the second sentence, the word ‘statistics’ is used as a singular noun,
meaning the subject which deals with the collection, presentation, analysis of data as
well as drawing of meaningful conclusions from the data.
In this chapter, we shall briefly discuss all these aspects regarding data.
14.2 Collection of Data
Let us begin with an exercise on gathering data by performing the following activity.
Activity 1 : Divide the students of your class into four groups. Allot each group the
work of collecting one of the following kinds of data:
(i) Heights of 20 students of your class.
(ii) Number of absentees in each day in your class for a month.
(iii) Number of members in the families of your classmates.
(iv) Heights of 15 plants in or around your school.
Let us move to the results students have gathered. How did they collect their data
in each group?
(i) Did they collect the information from each and every student, house or person
concerned for obtaining the information?
(ii) Did they get the information from some source like available school records?
In the first case, when the information was collected by the investigator herself or
himself with a definite objective in her or his mind, the data obtained is called primary
data.
In the second case, when the information was gathered from a source which
already had the information stored, the data obtained is called secondary data. Such
data, which has been collected by someone else in another context, needs to be used
with great care ensuring that the source is reliable.
By now, you must have understood how to collect data and distinguish between
primary and secondary data.
EXERCISE 14.1
1. Give five examples of data that you can collect from your day-to-day life.
2. Classify the data in Q.1 above as primary or secondary data.

14.3 Presentation of Data
As soon as the work related to collection of data is over, the investigator has to find out
ways to present them in a form which is meaningful, easily understood and gives its
main features at a glance. Let us now recall the various ways of presenting the data
through some examples.
Example 1 : Consider the marks obtained by 10 students in a mathematics test as
given below:
55 36 95 73 60 42 25 78 75 62
The data in this form is called raw data.
By looking at it in this form, can you find the highest and the lowest marks?
Did it take you some time to search for the maximum and minimum scores? Wouldn’t
it be less time consuming if these scores were arranged in ascending or descending
order? So let us arrange the marks in ascending order as
25 36 42 55 60 62 73 75 78 95
Now, we can clearly see that the lowest marks are 25 and the highest marks are 95.
The difference of the highest and the lowest values in the data is called the range of the
data. So, the range in this case is 95 – 25 = 70.
Presentation of data in ascending or descending order can be quite time consuming,
particularly when the number of observations in an experiment is large, as in the case
of the next example.
Example 2 : Consider the marks obtained (out of 100 marks) by 30 students of Class
IX of a school:
10 20 36 92 95 40 50 56 60 70
92 88 80 70 72 70 36 40 36 40
92 40 50 50 56 60 70 60 60 88
Recall that the number of students who have obtained a certain number of marks is
called the frequency of those marks. For instance, 4 students got 70 marks. So the
frequency of 70 marks is 4. To make the data more easily understandable, we write it
STATISTICS 241
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
in a table, as given below:
Table 14.1

56 2
60 4
70 4
72 1
80 1
88 2
92 3
95 1
Total 30
Table 14.1 is called an ungrouped frequency distribution table, or simply a frequency
distribution table. Note that you can use also tally marks in preparing these tables,
as in the next example.
Example 3 : 100 plants each were planted in 100 schools during Van Mahotsava.
After one month, the number of plants that survived were recorded as :
95 67 28 32 65 65 69 33 98 96
76 42 32 38 42 40 40 69 95 92
75 83 76 83 85 62 37 65 63 42
89 65 73 81 49 52 64 76 83 92
93 68 52 79 81 83 59 82 75 82
86 90 44 62 31 36 38 42 39 83
87 56 58 23 35 76 83 85 30 68
69 83 86 43 45 39 83 75 66 83
92 75 89 66 91 27 88 89 93 42

To present such a large amount of data so that a reader can make sense of it easily,
we condense it into groups like 20-29, 30-39, . . ., 90-99 (since our data is from
23 to 98). These groupings are called ‘classes’ or ‘class-intervals’, and their size is
called the class-size or class width, which is 10 in this case. In each of these classes,
the least number is called the lower class limit and the greatest number is called the
upper class limit, e.g., in 20-29, 20 is the ‘lower class limit’ and 29 is the ‘upper class
limit’.
Also, recall that using tally marks, the data above can be condensed in tabular
form as follows:
Table 14.2
Number of plants Tally Marks Number of schools
survived (frequency)
20 - 29 ||| 3
30 - 39 |||| |||| |||| 14
40 - 49 |||| |||| || 12
50 - 59 |||| ||| 8
60 - 69 |||| |||| |||| ||| 18
70 - 79 |||| |||| 10
80 - 89 |||| |||| |||| |||| ||| 23
90 - 99 |||| |||| || 12
Total 100
Presenting data in this form simplifies and condenses data and enables us to observe
certain important features at a glance. This is called a grouped frequency distribution
table. Here we can easily observe that 50% or more plants survived in 8 + 18 + 10 +
23 + 12 = 71 schools.
We observe that the classes in the table above are non-overlapping. Note that we
could have made more classes of shorter size, or fewer classes of larger size also. For
instance, the intervals could have been 22-26, 27-31, and so on. So, there is no hard
and fast rule about this except that the classes should not overlap.
Example 4 : Let us now consider the following frequency distribution table which
gives the weights of 38 students of a class:
STATISTICS 243
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
Table 14.3
Weights (in kg) Number of students
31 - 35 9
36 - 40 5
41 - 45 14
46 - 50 3
51 - 55 1
56 - 60 2
61 - 65 2
66 - 70 1
71 - 75 1
Total 38
Now, if two new students of weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg are admitted in this class,
then in which interval will we include them? We cannot add them in the ones ending
with 35 or 40, nor to the following ones. This is because there are gaps in between the
upper and lower limits of two consecutive classes. So, we need to divide the intervals
so that the upper and lower limits of consecutive intervals are the same. For this, we
find the difference between the upper limit of a class and the lower limit of its succeeding
class. We then add half of this difference to each of the upper limits and subtract the
same from each of the lower limits.
For example, consider the classes 31 - 35 and 36 - 40.
The lower limit of 36 - 40 = 36
The upper limit of 31 - 35 = 35
The difference = 36 – 35 = 1
So, half the difference =
1
2 = 0.5
So the new class interval formed from 31 - 35 is (31 – 0.5) - (35 + 0.5), i.e., 30.5 - 35.5.
Similarly, the new class formed from the class 36 - 40 is (36 – 0.5) - (40 + 0.5), i.e.,
35.5 - 40.5.
Continuing in the same manner, the continuous classes formed are:
30.5-35.5, 35.5-40.5, 40.5-45.5, 45.5-50.5, 50.5-55.5, 55.5-60.5,
60.5 - 65.5, 65.5 - 70.5, 70.5 - 75.5.
244 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
Now it is possible for us to include the weights of the new students in these classes.
But, another problem crops up because 35.5 appears in both the classes 30.5 - 35.5
and 35.5 - 40.5. In which class do you think this weight should be considered?
If it is considered in both classes, it will be counted twice.
By convention, we consider 35.5 in the class 35.5 - 40.5 and not in 30.5 - 35.5.
Similarly, 40.5 is considered in 40.5 - 45.5 and not in 35.5 - 40.5.
So, the new weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg would be included in 35.5 - 40.5 and
40.5 - 45.5, respectively. Now, with these assumptions, the new frequency distribution
table will be as shown below:
Table 14.4
Weights (in kg) Number of students
30.5-35.5 9
35.5-40.5 6
40.5-45.5 15

55.5-60.5 2
60.5-65.5 2
65.5-70.5 1
70.5-75.5 1
Total 40
Now, let us move to the data collected by you in Activity 1. This time we ask you to
present these as frequency distribution tables.
Activity 2 : Continuing with the same four groups, change your data to frequency
distribution tables.Choose convenient classes with suitable class-sizes, keeping in mind
the range of the data and the type of data.

14.4 Graphical Representation of Data
The representation of data by tables has already been discussed. Now let us turn our
attention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well
said that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the
individual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes
easier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical
representations in this section.
(A) Bar graphs
(B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths
(C) Frequency polygons
(A) Bar Graphs
In earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we
shall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a
pictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with
equal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The
values of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of
the bars depend on the values of the variable.
Example 5 : In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the
months of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:
Fig. 14.1
Observe the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:
(i) How many students were born in the month of November?
(ii) In which month were the maximum number of students born?
248 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
Solution : Note that the variable here is the ‘month of birth’, and the value of the
variable is the ‘Number of students born’.
(i) 4 students were born in the month of November.
(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.
Let us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.
Example 6 : A family with a monthly income of Rs 20,000 had planned the following
expenditures per month under various heads:
Table 14.5
Heads Expenditure
(in thousand rupees)
Grocery 4
Rent 5
Education of children 5
Medicine 2
Fuel 2
Entertainment 1
Miscellaneous 1
Draw a bar graph for the data above.
Solution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit
in the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means Rs 4000.
1. We represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,
since the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths
for all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by
one unit.
2. We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum
expenditure is Rs 5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = Rs 1000.
3. To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width
1 unit and height 4 units.
4. Similarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two
consecutive bars.
The bar graph is drawn in Fig. 14.2.

Fig. 14.2
Here, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,
the expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,
in some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.
Activity 3 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by
suitable bar graphs.
Let us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals
can be represented graphically.
(B) Histogram
This is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class
intervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 14.6, representing
the weights of 36 students of a class:
Table 14.6
Weights (in kg) Number of students
30.5 - 35.5 9
35.5 - 40.5 6
40.5 - 45.5 15
45.5 - 50.5 3
50.5 - 55.5 1
55.5 - 60.5 2
Total 36
250 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
Let us represent the data given above graphically as follows:
(i) We represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose
the scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5
and not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.
(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable
scale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to
accomodate this maximum frequency.
(iii) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size
and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For
example, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and
length 4.5 cm.
(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 14.3:
Fig. 14.3
Observe that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant
graph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical
representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike
a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.
Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding
frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of
the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths
according to (iii) above.

Now, consider a situation different from the one above.
Example 7 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students
in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a
few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to
group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70,
70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:
Table 14.7
Marks Number of students
 0 - 20 7
20 - 30 10
30 - 40 10
40 - 50 20
50 - 60 20
60 - 70 15
 70 - above 8
Total 90
A histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 14.4.
Fig. 14.4

Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents
the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned
earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.
Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.
But here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not
give a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval
70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.
So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that
the areas are again proportional to the frequencies.
The steps to be followed are as given below:
1. Select a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the
minimum class-size is 10.
2. The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the
class-size 10.
For instance, when the class-size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when
the class-size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be
7
20
× 10 = 3.5.
Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table:

Since we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,
we may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”.
So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 14.5.
Fig. 14.5
(C) Frequency Polygon
There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.
This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by
Fig. 14.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of
this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F
and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 14.6).
To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero
before 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,
respectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown
in Fig. 14.3. We have shown this in Fig. 14.6.

Although, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding
the highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to
make the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why
is this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.)
Now, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class
preceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.
Example 8 : Consider the marks, out of 100, obtained by 51 students of a class in a
test, given in Table 14.9.

Draw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.
Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the
tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is
0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative
direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end
point, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of
the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked
as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.
Then OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 14.7.

Frequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing
histograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.
These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks.
To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and
lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus,
Class-mark =
Upper limit + Lower limit
2
Let us consider an example.
Example 9 : In a city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living
index are given in the following table:
Table 14.10
Cost of living index Number of weeks
140 - 150 5
150 - 160 10

190 - 200 2

Draw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram).
Solution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find
the class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160,....
For 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140
So, the class-mark =
150 + 140
2
 =
290

 = 145.
Continuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well.

So, the new table obtained is as shown in the following table:

170 - 180 175 9
180 - 190 185 6
190 - 200 195 2
Total 52
We can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal
axis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points
B(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F(185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments.
We should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class
130 - 140 (just before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is,
A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2). So, the resultant
frequency polygon will be ABCDEFGH (see Fig. 14.8).

Frequency polygons are used when the data is continuous and very large. It is
very useful for comparing two different sets of data of the same nature, for example,
comparing the performance of two different sections of the same class.

14.5 Measures of Central Tendency
Earlier in this chapter, we represented the data in various forms through frequency
distribution tables, bar graphs, histograms and frequency polygons. Now, the question
arises if we always need to study all the data to ‘make sense’ of it, or if we can make
out some important features of it by considering only certain representatives of the
data. This is possible, by using measures of central tendency or averages.
Consider a situation when two students Mary and Hari received their test copies.
The test had five questions, each carrying ten marks. Their scores were as follows:
Question Numbers 12345
Mary’s score 10 8 9 8 7
Hari’s score 4 7 10 10 10
262 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
Upon getting the test copies, both of them found their average scores as follows:
Mary’s average score =
42
5
 = 8.4
Hari’s average score =
41
5
 = 8.2
Since Mary’s average score was more than Hari’s, Mary claimed to have performed
better than Hari, but Hari did not agree. He arranged both their scores in ascending
order and found out the middle score as given below:
Mary’s Score 7 8 8 9 10
Hari’s Score 4 7 10 10 10
 Hari said that since his middle-most score was 10, which was higher than Mary’s
middle-most score, that is 8, his performance should be rated better.
But Mary was not convinced. To convince Mary, Hari tried out another strategy.
He said he had scored 10 marks more often (3 times) as compared to Mary who
scored 10 marks only once. So, his performance was better.
Now, to settle the dispute between Hari and Mary, let us see the three measures
they adopted to make their point.
The average score that Mary found in the first case is the mean. The ‘middle’
score that Hari was using for his argument is the median. The most often scored mark
that Hari used in his second strategy is the mode.
Now, let us first look at the mean in detail.
The mean (or average) of a number of observations is the sum of the values of
all the observations divided by the total number of observations.
It is denoted by the symbol x , read as ‘x bar’.
Let us consider an example.
Example 10 : 5 people were asked about the time in a week they spend in doing
social work in their community. They said 10, 7, 13, 20 and 15 hours, respectively.
Find the mean (or average) time in a week devoted by them for social work.
Solution : We have already studied in our earlier classes that the mean of a certain
number of observations is equal to Sum of all the observations
Total number of observations
. To simplify our
STATISTICS 263
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
working of finding the mean, let us use a variable xi to denote the ith observation. In
this case, i can take the values from 1 to 5. So our first observation is x1
, second
observation is x2, and so on till x5
.
Also x1
 = 10 means that the value of the first observation, denoted by x1
, is 10.
Similarly, x2 = 7, x3 = 13, x4 = 20 and x5 = 15.
Therefore, the mean x =
Sum of all the observations
Total number of observations
= 123 4 5
5
x  xxxx
= 10 7 13 20 15
5
  
 =

5 = 13
So, the mean time spent by these 5 people in doing social work is 13 hours in a week.
Now, in case we are finding the mean time spent by 30 people in doing social
work, writing x1 + x2
 + x3
 + . . . + x30 would be a tedious job.We use the Greek symbol
Σ (for the letter Sigma) for summation. Instead of writing x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + x30 , we
write
30

i

x

 , which is read as ‘the sum of xi
 as i varies from 1 to 30’.
So, x =

Similarly, for n observations x =

Is the process not time consuming? Can we simplify it? Note that we have formed
a frequency table for this data (see Table 14.1).
The table shows that 1 student obtained 10 marks, 1 student obtained 20 marks, 3
students obtained 36 marks, 4 students obtained 40 marks, 3 students obtained 50
marks, 2 students obtained 56 marks, 4 students obtained 60 marks, 4 students obtained
70 marks, 1 student obtained 72 marks, 1 student obtained 80 marks, 2 students obtained
88 marks, 3 students obtained 92 marks and 1 student obtained 95 marks.
So, the total marks obtained = (1 × 10) + (1 × 20) + (3 × 36) + (4 × 40) + (3 × 50)
+ (2 × 56) + (4 × 60) + (4 × 70) + (1 × 72) + (1 × 80)

for calculating the mean.
Let us now move back to the situation of the argument between Hari and Mary,
and consider the second case where Hari found his performance better by finding the
middle-most score. As already stated, this measure of central tendency is called the
median.
The median is that value of the given number of observations, which divides it into
exactly two parts. So, when the data is arranged in ascending (or descending) order
the median of ungrouped data is calculated as follows:
266 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006).PM65
(i) When the number of observations (n) is odd, the median is the value of the

 observations, i.e., the mean of the
values of the 8th and 9th observations will be the median [see Fig. 14.9 (ii)].
Fig. 14.9
Let us illustrate this with the help of some examples.
Example 12 : The heights (in cm) of 9 students of a class are as follows:
155 160 145 149 150 147 152 144 148
Find the median of this data.
Solution : First of all we arrange the data in ascending order, as follows:
144 145 147 148 149 150 152 155 160
Since the number of students is 9, an odd number, we find out the median by finding

So, the median, i.e., the medial height is 149 cm.
Example 13 : The points scored by a Kabaddi team in a series of matches are as
follows:
17, 2, 7, 27, 15, 5, 14, 8, 10, 24, 48, 10, 8, 7, 18, 28
Find the median of the points scored by the team.
Solution : Arranging the points scored by the team in ascending order, we get
2, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 24, 27, 28, 48.
There are 16 terms. So there are two middle terms, i.e. the
16
2
th and
16 1
2
      th, i.e.,
the 8th and 9th terms.
So, the median is the mean of the values of the 8th and 9th terms.
i.e, the median =
10 14
2

 = 12
So, the medial point scored by the Kabaddi team is 12.
Let us again go back to the unsorted dispute of Hari and Mary.
The third measure used by Hari to find the average was the mode.
The mode is that value of the observation which occurs most frequently, i.e., an
observation with the maximum frequency is called the mode.
The readymade garment and shoe industries make great use of this measure of
central tendency. Using the knowledge of mode, these industries decide which size of
the product should be produced in large numbers.
Let us illustrate this with the help of an example.
Example 14 : Find the mode of the following marks (out of 10) obtained by 20
students:
4, 6, 5, 9, 3, 2, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 9, 10, 10, 3, 4, 7, 6, 9, 9
Solution : We arrange this data in the following form :
2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10
Here 9 occurs most frequently, i.e., four times. So, the mode is 9.

Example 15 : Consider a small unit of a factory where there are 5 employees : a
supervisor and four labourers. The labourers draw a salary of ` 5,000 per month each
while the supervisor gets ` 15,000 per month. Calculate the mean, median and mode
of the salaries of this unit of the factory.
Solution : Mean =
5000 5000 5000 5000 15000
5

 =
35000
5
 = 7000
So, the mean salary is ` 7000 per month.
To obtain the median, we arrange the salaries in ascending order:
5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 15000
Since the number of employees in the factory is 5, the median is given by the
51 6 th
2 2
        th = 3rd observation. Therefore, the median is ` 5000 per month.
To find the mode of the salaries, i.e., the modal salary, we see that 5000 occurs the
maximum number of times in the data 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 15000. So, the modal
salary is ` 5000 per month.
Now compare the three measures of central tendency for the given data in the
example above. You can see that the mean salary of ` 7000 does not give even an
approximate estimate of any one of their wages, while the medial and modal salaries
of ` 5000 represents the data more effectively.
Extreme values in the data affect the mean. This is one of the weaknesses of the
mean. So, if the data has a few points which are very far from most of the other
points, (like 1,7,8,9,9) then the mean is not a good representative of this data. Since the
median and mode are not affected by extreme values present in the data, they give a
better estimate of the average in such a situation.
Again let us go back to the situation of Hari and Mary, and compare the three
measures of central tendency.
Measures Hari Mary
of central tendency
Mean 8.2 8.4
Median 10 8
Mode 10 8
This comparison helps us in stating that these measures of central tendency are not
sufficient for concluding which student is better. We require some more information to
conclude this, which you will study about in the higher classes.

EXERCISE 14.4
1. The following number of goals were scored by a team in a series of 10 matches:
2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3
Find the mean, median and mode of these scores.
2. In a mathematics test given to 15 students, the following marks (out of 100) are
recorded:
41, 39, 48, 52, 46, 62, 54, 40, 96, 52, 98, 40, 42, 52, 60
Find the mean, median and mode of this data.
3. The following observations have been arranged in ascending order. If the median of
the data is 63, find the value of x.
29, 32, 48, 50, x, x + 2, 72, 78, 84, 95
4. Find the mode of 14, 25, 14, 28, 18, 17, 18, 14, 23, 22, 14, 18.
5. Find the mean salary of 60 workers of a factory from the following table:
Salary (in `) Number of workers
3000 16
4000 12
5000 10
6000 8
7000 6
8000 4
9000 3
10000 1
Total 60
6. Give one example of a situation in which
(i) the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency.
(ii) the mean is not an appropriate measure of central tendency but the median is an
appropriate measure of central tendency.

14.6 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. Facts or figures, collected with a definite purpose, are called data.
2. Statistics is the area of study dealing with the presentation, analysis and interpretation of
data.
3. How data can be presented graphically in the form of bar graphs, histograms and frequency
polygons.
4. The three measures of central tendency for ungrouped data are:
(i) Mean : It is found by adding all the values of the observations and dividing it by the
total number of observations. It is denoted by x .
So, x =
