CHAPTER 13
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
13.1 Introduction
Wherever we look, usually we see solids. So far, in all our study, we have been dealing
with figures that can be easily drawn on our notebooks or blackboards. These are
called plane figures. We have understood what rectangles, squares and circles are,
what we mean by their perimeters and areas, and how we can find them. We have
learnt these in earlier classes. It would be interesting to see what happens if we cut
out many of these plane figures of the same shape and size from cardboard sheet and
stack them up in a vertical pile. By this process, we shall obtain some solid figures
(briefly called solids) such as a cuboid, a cylinder, etc. In the earlier classes, you have
also learnt to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids, cubes and cylinders. We
shall now learn to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids and cylinders in
details and extend this study to some other solids such as cones and spheres.
13.2 Surface Area of a Cuboid and a Cube
Have you looked at a bundle of many sheets of paper? How does it look? Does it look
like what you see in Fig. 13.1?
Fig. 13.1
That makes up a cuboid. How much of brown paper would you need, if you want
to cover this cuboid? Let us see:
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 209
First we would need a rectangular piece to cover
the bottom of the bundle. That would be as shown in
Fig. 13.2 (a)
Then we would need two long rectangular pieces
to cover the two side ends. Now, it would look like
Fig. 13.2 (b).
Now to cover the front and back ends, we would
need two more rectangular pieces of a different size.
With them, we would now have a figure as shown in
Fig. 13.2(c).
This figure, when opened out, would look like
Fig. 13.2 (d).
Finally, to cover the top of the bundle, we would
require another rectangular piece exactly like the one
at the bottom, which if we attach on the right side, it
would look like Fig. 13.2(e).
So we have used six rectangular pieces to cover
the complete outer surface of the cuboid.
Fig. 13.2
210 MATHEMATICS
This shows us that the outer surface of a cuboid is made up of six rectangles (in
fact, rectangular regions, called the faces of the cuboid), whose areas can be found by
multiplying length by breadth for each of them separately and then adding the six
areas together.
Now, if we take the length of the cuboid as l, breadth as b and the height as h, then
the figure with these dimensions would be like the shape you see in Fig. 13.2(f).
So, the sum of the areas of the six rectangles is:
Area of rectangle 1 (= l × h)
+
Area of rectangle 2 (= l × b)
+
Area of rectangle 3 (= l × h)
+
Area of rectangle 4 (= l × b)
+
Area of rectangle 5 (= b × h)
+
Area of rectangle 6 (= b × h)
= 2(l × b) + 2(b × h) + 2(l × h)
= 2(lb + bh + hl)
This gives us:
Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2(lb + bh + hl)
where l, b and h are respectively the three edges of the cuboid.
Note : The unit of area is taken as the square unit, because we measure the magnitude
of a region by filling it with squares of side of unit length.
For example, if we have a cuboid whose length, breadth and height are 15 cm,
10 cm and 20 cm respectively, then its surface area would be:
2[(15 × 10) + (10 × 20) + (20 × 15)] cm2
= 2(150 + 200 + 300) cm2
= 2 × 650 cm2
= 1300 cm2
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 211
Recall that a cuboid, whose length, breadth and height are all equal, is called a
cube. If each edge of the cube is a, then the surface area of this cube would be
2(a × a + a × a + a × a), i.e., 6a2 (see Fig. 13.3), giving us
Surface Area of a Cube = 6a 2
where a is the edge of the cube.
Fig. 13.3
Suppose, out of the six faces of a cuboid, we only find the area of the four faces,
leaving the bottom and top faces. In such a case, the area of these four faces is called
the lateral surface area of the cuboid. So, lateral surface area of a cuboid of
length l, breadth b and height h is equal to 2lh + 2bh or 2(l + b)h. Similarly,
lateral surface area of a cube of side a is equal to 4a2.
Keeping in view of the above, the surface area of a cuboid (or a cube) is sometimes
also referred to as the total surface area. Let us now solve some examples.
Example 1 : Mary wants to decorate her Christmas
tree. She wants to place the tree on a wooden box
covered with coloured paper with picture of Santa
Claus on it (see Fig. 13.4). She must know the exact
quantity of paper to buy for this purpose. If the box
has length, breadth and height as 80 cm, 40 cm and
20 cm respectively how many square sheets of paper
of side 40 cm would she require?
Solution : Since Mary wants to paste the paper on
the outer surface of the box; the quantity of paper
required would be equal to the surface area of the
box which is of the shape of a cuboid. The dimensions
of the box are:
Fig. 13.4
212 MATHEMATICS
Length =80 cm, Breadth = 40 cm, Height = 20 cm.
The surface area of the box = 2(lb + bh + hl)
= 2[(80 × 40) + (40 × 20) + (20 × 80)] cm2
= 2[3200 + 800 + 1600] cm2
= 2 × 5600 cm2
 = 11200 cm2
The area of each sheet of the paper = 40 × 40 cm2
 = 1600 cm2
Therefore, number of sheets required = surface area of box
area of one sheet of paper
= 11200
1600 = 7
So, she would require 7 sheets.
Example 2 : Hameed has built a cubical water tank with lid for his house, with each
outer edge 1.5 m long. He gets the outer surface of the tank excluding the base,
covered with square tiles of side 25 cm (see Fig. 13.5). Find how much he would
spend for the tiles, if the cost of the tiles is ` 360 per dozen.
Solution : Since Hameed is getting the five outer faces of the tank covered with tiles,
he would need to know the surface area of the tank, to decide on the number of tiles
required.
Edge of the cubical tank = 1.5 m = 150 cm (= a)
So, surface area of the tank = 5 × 150 × 150 cm2
Area of each square tile = side × side = 25 × 25 cm2
So, the number of tiles required =
surface area of the tank
area of each tile
= 5 × 150 × 150
25× 25
 = 180
Cost of 1 dozen tiles, i.e., cost of 12 tiles = ` 360
Therefore, cost of one tile = ` 360
12
 = ` 30
So, the cost of 180 tiles = 180 × ` 30 = ` 5400

as a flap which can be rolled up). Assuming that the stitching margins are very small,
and therefore negligible, how much tarpaulin would be required to make the shelter of
height 2.5 m, with base dimensions 4 m × 3 m?
214 MATHEMATICS
13.3 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cylinder
If we take a number of circular sheets of paper and stack them up as we stacked up
rectangular sheets earlier, what would we get (see Fig. 13.6)?
Fig. 13.6
Here, if the stack is kept vertically up, we get what is called a right circular
cylinder, since it has been kept at right angles to the base, and the base is circular. Let
us see what kind of cylinder is not a right circular cylinder.
In Fig 13.7 (a), you see a cylinder, which
is certainly circular, but it is not at right angles
to the base. So, we can not say this a right
circular cylinder.
Of course, if we have a cylinder with a
non circular base, as you see in Fig. 13.7 (b),
then we also cannot call it a right circular
cylinder.
Remark : Here, we will be dealing with only right circular cylinders. So, unless stated
otherwise, the word cylinder would mean a right circular cylinder.
Now, if a cylinder is to be covered with coloured paper, how will we do it with the
minimum amount of paper? First take a rectangular sheet of paper, whose length is
just enough to go round the cylinder and whose breadth is equal to the height of the
cylinder as shown in Fig. 13.8.
Fig. 13.7
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 215
Fig. 13.8
The area of the sheet gives us the curved surface area of the cylinder. Note that
the length of the sheet is equal to the circumference of the circular base which is equal
to 2πr.
So, curved surface area of the cylinder
= area of the rectangular sheet = length × breadth
= perimeter of the base of the cylinder × h
= 2πr × h
Therefore, Curved Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πrh
where r is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.
Remark : In the case of a cylinder, unless stated
otherwise, ‘radius of a cylinder’ shall mean’ base radius
of the cylinder’.
If the top and the bottom of the cylinder are also to
be covered, then we need two circles (infact, circular
regions) to do that, each of radius r, and thus having an
area of πr2
 each (see Fig. 13.9), giving us the total
surface area as 2πrh + 2πr2
 = 2πr(r + h).
So, Total Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2πr(r + h)
where h is the height of the cylinder and r its radius.
Remark : You may recall from Chapter 1 that π is an irrational number. So, the value
Fig. 13.9
l
216 MATHEMATICS
of π is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal. But when we use its value in our
calculations, we usually take its value as approximately equal to
22
7
 or 3.14.
Example 3 : Savitri had to make a model of a cylindrical kaleidoscope for her science
project. She wanted to use chart paper to make the curved surface of the kaleidoscope.
(see Fig 13.10). What would be the area of chart paper required by her, if she wanted
to make a kaleidoscope of length 25 cm with a 3.5 cm radius? You may take π =
22
7 .
Solution : Radius of the base of the cylindrical kaleidoscope (r) = 3.5 cm.
Height (length) of kaleidoscope (h) = 25 cm.
Area of chart paper required = curved surface area of the kaleidoscope
= 2πrh
= 22 2 2 3.5 25 cm

the competitors with cardboard. If there were 35 competitors, how much cardboard
was required to be bought for the competition?
13.4 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cone
So far, we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally,
such figures are called prisms. Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a
prism (These kinds of solids are called pyramids.). Let us see how we can generate
them.
Activity : Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick
string along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 13.13(a)].
Hold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle
Fig. 13.12
218 MATHEMATICS
about the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that
the triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 13.13(b)]? Does it
remind you of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that
shape [see Fig. 13.13 (c) and (d)]?
Fig. 13.13
This is called a right circular cone. In Fig. 13.13(c)
of the right circular cone, the point A is called the
vertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius
and AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B
will be the centre of circular base of the cone. The
height, radius and slant height of the cone are usually
denoted by h, r and l respectively. Once again, let us
see what kind of cone we can not call a right circular
cone. Here, you are (see Fig. 13.14)! What you see
in these figures are not right circular cones; because
in (a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its
base is not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the
base is not circular.
As in the case of cylinder, since we will be studying only about right circular cones,
remember that by ‘cone’ in this chapter, we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’
Activity : (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped
paper, straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms
the surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height of
the cone which is represented by l). It looks like a part of a round cake.
Fig. 13.14
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 219
(ii) If you now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together, you can see that
the curved portion of Fig. 13.15 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.
Fig. 13.15
(iii) If the paper like the one in Fig. 13.15 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,
along the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,
whose height is the slant height l of the cone.
(iv) Now the area of each triangle =
1
2
 × base of each triangle × l.
So, area of the entire piece of paper
= sum of the areas of all the triangles
= 1 23
11 1

bl bl b l  L =   12 3

lb b b  L
= 1
2 × l × length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 13.15(c)
(as b1 + b2 + b3
 + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)
But the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone
and the circumference of the base of the cone = 2πr, where r is the base radius of the
cone.
So, Curved Surface Area of a Cone =
1
2
 × l × 2πr = πrl
where r is its base radius and l its slant height.
Note that l
2
 = r2
 + h2
 (as can be seen from Fig. 13.16), by
applying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the height of the
cone.
Fig. 13.16
220 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, l = 2 2 r h 
Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r
is also required whose area is πr2
.
So, Total Surface Area of a Cone = πrl + πr2 = πr(l + r)
Example 4 : Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height
is 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm.
Solution : Curved surface area = πrl
= 22
7
 × 7 × 10 cm2
= 220 cm2
Example 5 : The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the
curved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use π = 3.14).
Solution : Here, h = 16 cm and r = 12 cm.
So, from l
2
 = h2
 + r2
, we have
l = 2 2 16 12  cm = 20 cm
So, curved surface area = πrl
= 3.14 × 12 × 20 cm2
= 753.6 cm2
Further, total surface area = πrl + πr2
= (753.6 + 3.14 × 12 × 12) cm2
= (753.6 + 452.16) cm2
= 1205.76 cm2
Example 6 : A corn cob (see Fig. 13.17), shaped somewhat
like a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and
length (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm2
 of the surface of the
cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains
you would find on the entire cob.
Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn
cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total
number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we
need to find its slant height.
Fig. 13.17
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 221
Here, l = 2 2 r h  = 2 2 (2.1) 20  cm
= 404.41 cm = 20.11 cm
Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob = πrl
= 22
7
 × 2.1 × 20.11 cm2
 = 132.726 cm2
 = 132.73 cm2 (approx.)
Number of grains of corn on 1 cm2
 of the surface of the corn cob = 4
Therefore, number of grains on the entire curved surface of the cob
= 132.73 × 4 = 530.92 = 531 (approx.)
So, there would be approximately 531 grains of corn on the cob.
EXERCISE 13.3

22
7 , unless stated otherwise.

cones made of recycled cardboard. Each cone has a base diameter of 40 cm and height
1 m. If the outer side of each of the cones is to be painted and the cost of painting is
` 12 per m2, what will be the cost of painting all these cones? (Use π = 3.14 and take
1.04 = 1.02)
222 MATHEMATICS
13.5 Surface Area of a Sphere
What is a sphere? Is it the same as a circle? Can you draw a circle on a paper? Yes,
you can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant
distance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.
Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had
rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 13.18). What
does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.
Fig. 13.18
Can you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on
rotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three
dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space,
which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the
centre of the sphere.
Note : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the
solid whose surface is a sphere.
Activity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone
play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take
a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string
around the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep
the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,
till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 13.19(a)]. Mark the starting and
finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.
Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which
you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 223
to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had
wound around the ball [see Fig. 13.19(b)].
Fig. 13.19
What have you achieved in all this?
The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been
used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.
So, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r
= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × (π r
2
)
So, Surface Area of a Sphere = 4 π r2
where r is the radius of the sphere.
How many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is
curved.
Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through
the middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What
happens to the sphere?
Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 13.20)!
What will each half be called? It is called a hemisphere.
(Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’)
And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?
Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base).
The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which
is
1
2
 of 4πr2.
Fig. 13.20
224 MATHEMATICS
Therefore, Curved Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 2πr2
where r is the radius of the sphere of which the hemisphere is a part.
Now taking the two faces of a hemisphere, its surface area 2πr2
 + πr
2
So, Total Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 3πr
2
Example 7 : Find the surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm.
Solution : The surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm would be
4πr2
 = 4 ×
22
7
 × 7 × 7 cm2
 = 616 cm2
Example 8 : Find (i) the curved surface area and (ii) the total surface area of a
hemisphere of radius 21 cm.
Solution : The curved surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm would be
= 2πr2 = 2 ×
22
7
 × 21 × 21 cm2 = 2772 cm2
(ii) the total surface area of the hemisphere would be
3πr
2 = 3 ×
22
7
 × 21 × 21 cm2 = 4158 cm2
Example 9 : The hollow sphere, in which the circus motorcyclist performs his stunts,
has a diameter of 7 m. Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding.
Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m. So, the riding
space available for the motorcyclist is the surface area of the ‘sphere’ which is
given by
4πr2 = 4 ×
22
7
 × 3.5 × 3.5 m2

Example 10 : A hemispherical dome of a building needs to be painted
(see Fig. 13.21). If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost
of painting it, given the cost of painting is ` 5 per 100 cm2.
Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need
to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that
needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 2πr.
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 225
So, the radius of the dome = 17.6 ×

 m = 2.8 m
The curved surface area of the dome = 2πr2

Now, cost of painting 100 cm2 is ` 5.
So, cost of painting 1 m2 = ` 500
Therefore, cost of painting the whole dome
= ` 500 × 49.28
= ` 24640

13.6 Volume of a Cuboid
You have already learnt about volumes of certain figures (objects) in earlier classes.
Recall that solid objects occupy space. The measure of this occupied space is called
the Volume of the object.
Note : If an object is solid, then the space occupied by such an object is measured,
and is termed the Volume of the object. On the other hand, if the object is hollow, then
interior is empty, and can be filled with air, or some liquid that will take the shape of its
container. In this case, the volume of the substance that can fill the interior is called the
capacity of the container. In short, the volume of an object is the measure of the
space it occupies, and the capacity of an object is the volume of substance its interior
can accommodate. Hence, the unit of measurement of either of the two is cubic unit.
So, if we were to talk of the volume of a cuboid, we would be considering the
measure of the space occupied by the cuboid.
Further, the area or the volume is measured as the magnitude of a region. So,
correctly speaking, we should be finding the area of a circular region, or volume of a
cuboidal region, or volume of a spherical region, etc. But for the sake of simplicity, we
say, find the area of a circle, volume of a cuboid or a sphere even though these mean
only their boundaries.
Fig. 13.23
Observe Fig. 13.23. Suppose we say that the area of each rectangle is A, the
height up to which the rectangles are stacked is h and the volume of the cuboid is V.
Can you tell what would be the relationship between V, A and h?
The area of the plane region occupied by each rectangle × height
= Measure of the space occupied by the cuboid
So, we get A × h = V
That is, Volume of a Cuboid = base area × height = length × breadth × height
or l × b × h, where l, b and h are respectively the length, breadth and height of the
cuboid.
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 227
Note : When we measure the magnitude of the region of a space, that is, the
space occupied by a solid, we do so by counting the number of cubes of edge of unit
length that can fit into it exactly. Therefore, the unit of measurement of volume is
cubic unit.
Again Volume of a Cube = edge × edge × edge = a3
where a is the edge of the cube (see Fig. 13.24).
So, if a cube has edge of 12 cm,
then volume of the cube = 12 × 12 × 12 cm3
 = 1728 cm3.
Recall that you have learnt these formulae in
earlier classes. Now let us take some examples to
illustrate the use of these formulae:
Example11 : A wall of length 10 m was to be built across an open ground. The height
of the wall is 4 m and thickness of the wall is 24 cm. If this wall is to be built up with
bricks whose dimensions are 24 cm × 12 cm × 8 cm, how many bricks would be
required?
Solution : Since the wall with all its bricks makes up the space occupied by it, we
need to find the volume of the wall, which is nothing but a cuboid.
Here, Length = 10 m = 1000 cm
Thickness = 24 cm
Height = 4 m = 400 cm
Therefore, Volume of the wall = length × thickness × height
= 1000 × 24 × 400 cm3
Now, each brick is a cuboid with length = 24 cm, breadth = 12 cm and height = 8 cm
So, volume of each brick = length × breadth × height
 = 24 × 12 × 8 cm3
So, number of bricks required =
volume of the wall
volume of each brick
= 1000 × 24 × 400
24 × 12 × 8
= 4166.6
So, the wall requires 4167 bricks.
Fig. 13.24
228 MATHEMATICS
Example 12 : A child playing with building blocks, which are
of the shape of cubes, has built a structure as shown in
Fig. 13.25. If the edge of each cube is 3 cm, find the volume
of the structure built by the child.
Solution : Volume of each cube = edge × edge × edge
 = 3 × 3 × 3 cm3
 = 27 cm3
Number of cubes in the structure = 15
Therefore, volume of the structure = 27 × 15 cm3
 = 405 cm3

13.7 Volume of a Cylinder
Just as a cuboid is built up with rectangles of the same size, we have seen that a right
circular cylinder can be built up using circles of the same size. So, using the same
argument as for a cuboid, we can see that the volume of a cylinder can be obtained
Fig. 13.25

as : base area × height
= area of circular base × height = πr

So, Volume of a Cylinder = πr2h
where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
Example 13 : The pillars of a temple are cylindrically
shaped (see Fig. 13.26). If each pillar has a circular
base of radius 20 cm and height 10 m, how much
concrete mixture would be required to build 14 such
pillars?
Solution : Since the concrete mixture that is to be
used to build up the pillars is going to occupy the
entire space of the pillar, what we need to find here
is the volume of the cylinders.
Radius of base of a cylinder = 20 cm
Height of the cylindrical pillar = 10 m = 1000 cm
So, volume of each cylinder = πr2h
= 22

So, 14 pillars would need 17.6 m3

Example 14 : At a Ramzan Mela, a stall keeper in one
of the food stalls has a large cylindrical vessel of base

juice. The juice is filled in small cylindrical glasses (see
Fig. 13.27) of radius 3 cm up to a height of 8 cm, and
sold for ` 3 each. How much money does the stall keeper
receive by selling the juice completely? Fig. 13.27
Fig. 13.26
230 MATHEMATICS
Solution : The volume of juice in the vessel
= volume of the cylindrical vessel
= πR2H
(where R and H are taken as the radius and height respectively of the vessel)
= π × 15 × 15 × 32 cm3
Similarly, the volume of juice each glass can hold = πr2
h
(where r and h are taken as the radius and height respectively of each glass)
= π × 3 × 3 × 8 cm3
So, number of glasses of juice that are sold

Therefore, amount received by the stall keeper = ` 3 × 100

13.8 Volume of a Right Circular Cone
In Fig 13.28, can you see that there is a right circular
cylinder and a right circular cone of the same base
radius and the same height?
Activity : Try to make a hollow cylinder and a hollow cone like this with the same
base radius and the same height (see Fig. 13.28). Then, we can try out an experiment
that will help us, to see practically what the volume of a right circular cone would be!
Fig. 13.29
Fig. 13.28
232 MATHEMATICS
So, let us start like this.
Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find
that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 13.29(a)].
When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see
that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 13.29(b)].
When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be
seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 13.29(c)].
With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a
cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the
same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the
volume of the cylinder.
So, Volume of a Cone =
1

πr
2h
where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone.
Example 15 : The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm
respectively. Find the volume of the cone.
Solution : From l

r = 22 2 2 l h    28 21 cm 7 7 cm

Example 16 : Monica has a piece of canvas whose area is 551 m2
. She uses it to
have a conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching
margins and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m2
, find
the volume of the tent that can be made with it.
Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m2
 and area of the canvas lost in
wastage is 1 m2, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is
(551 – 1) m2
 = 550 m2
.
Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m2
 and the required base radius of the conical
tent = 7 m
Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by
canvas!!).
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 233
Therefore, curved surface area of tent = 550 m2

That is, πrl = 550

13.9 Volume of a Sphere
Now, let us see how to go about measuring the volume of a sphere. First, take two or
three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of
the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the
container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 13.30(a)].
Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from
the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 13.30(b)].
Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated
cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 13.30(c)]. Suppose the
radius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter
of the sphere). Then evaluate
4
3 πr3
. Do you find this value almost equal to the
measure of the volume over flowed?
Fig. 13.30
Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere.
Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of 4 3 R .
3
 Once again this
value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed)
by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the
same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment
repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the
volume of a sphere is equal to
4
3
 times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea
that
Volume of a Sphere = 
4 3

r
where r is the radius of the sphere.
Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it
as true.

the product of its volume and density, we need to find the volume of the sphere.
