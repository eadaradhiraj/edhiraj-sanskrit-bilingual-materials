CHAPTER 4
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
The principal use of the Analytic Art is to bring Mathematical Problems to
Equations and to exhibit those Equations in the most simple terms that can be.
—Edmund Halley
4.1 Introduction
In earlier classes, you have studied linear equations in one variable. Can you write
down a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x + 2 = 0 and
2 y + 3 = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that
such equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember
how to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear
equations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You
will be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a
solution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane?
You shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions.
4.2Linear Equations
Let us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation:
2x + 5 = 0
Its solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is 5
2
 . This can be represented on the
number line as shown below:
Fig. 4.1

While solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind:
The solution of a linear equation is not affected when:
(i) the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation.
(ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero
number.
Let us now consider the following situation:
In a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in
Nagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the
form of an equation.
Here, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two
unknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored
by one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know
that
x + y = 176,
which is the required equation.
This is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote
the variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some
examples of linear equations in two variables are:
1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q = 7, πu + 5v = 9 and 3 = 2 x – 7y.
Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.2s + 3t – 5 = 0,
p + 4q – 7 = 0, πu + 5v – 9 = 0 and 2 x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively.
So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c
are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two
variables. This means that you can think of many many such equations.
Example 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and
indicate the values of a, b and c in each case:
(i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 (ii) x – 4 = 3 y (iii) 4 = 5x – 3y (iv) 2x = y
Solution : (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y – 4.37 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3
and c = – 4.37.
(ii) The equation x – 4 = 3 y can be written as x – 3 y – 4 = 0. Here a = 1,
b = – 3 and c = – 4.
(iii) The equation 4 = 5x – 3y can be written as 5x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 5, b = –3
and c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this
case a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4.

(iv) The equation 2x = y can be written as 2x – y + 0 = 0. Here a = 2, b = –1 and
c = 0.
Equations of the type ax + b = 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables
because they can be expressed as
ax + 0.y + b = 0
For example, 4 – 3x = 0 can be written as –3x + 0.y + 4 = 0.
Example 2 : Write each of the following as an equation in two variables:
(i) x = –5 (ii) y = 2 (iii) 2x = 3 (iv) 5y = 2
Solution : (i) x = –5 can be written as 1.x + 0.y = –5, or 1.x + 0.y + 5 = 0.
(ii) y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 1.y = 2, or 0.x + 1.y – 2 = 0.
(iii) 2x = 3 can be written as 2x + 0.y – 3 = 0.
(iv) 5y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 5y – 2 = 0.
EXERCISE 4.1
1. The cost of a notebook is twice the cost of a pen. Write a linear equation in two
variables to represent this statement.
(Take the cost of a notebook to be ` x and that of a pen to be ` y).
2. Express the following linear equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and indicate the
values of a, b and c in each case:
(i) 2x + 3y = 9.35 (ii) x – 5
y – 10 = 0 (iii) –2x + 3y = 6 (iv) x = 3y
(v) 2x = –5y (vi) 3x + 2 = 0 (vii) y – 2 = 0 (viii) 5 = 2x
4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation
You have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution. What
can you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there
are two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one
for y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12.
Here, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the
equation above, you find that
2x + 3y = (2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12
This solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and
then the value for y. Similarly, (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above.
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 69

On the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 12, because on putting
x = 1 and y = 4 we get 2x + 3y = 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but
not (4, 0).
You have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can
you find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the
same. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of
your choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12,
which is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y =
8
3 . So 8 2, 3
     
 is
another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. Similarly, choosing x = – 5, you find that the equation
becomes –10 + 3y = 12. This gives y =
22
3 . So, 22 5, 3
    
 
 is another solution of
2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two
variables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.
Example 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6.
Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2
x + 2y = 2 + 4 = 6
Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6
which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6.
Similarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y = 0 is a solution
of x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to
x + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the
given equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are:
(2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1).
Remark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the
corresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding
value of x.
Example 4 : Find two solutions for each of the following equations:
(i) 4x + 3y = 12
(ii) 2x + 5y = 0
(iii) 3y + 4 = 0
Solution : (i) Taking x = 0, we get 3y = 12, i.e., y = 4. So, (0, 4) is a solution of the
given equation. Similarly, by taking y = 0, we get x = 3. Thus, (3, 0) is also a solution.
(ii) Taking x = 0, we get 5y = 0, i.e., y = 0. So (0, 0) is a solution of the given equation.

Now, if you take y = 0, you again get (0, 0) as a solution, which is the same as the
earlier one. To get another solution, take x = 1, say. Then you can check that the
corresponding value of y is
2.

(iii) Writing the equation 3y + 4 = 0 as 0.x + 3y + 4 = 0, you will find that y =

any value of x. Thus, two solutions can be given as 4 4 0, – and 1, – 3 3

4.4 Graph of a Linear Equation in Two Variables
So far, you have obtained the solutions of a linear equation in two variables algebraically.
Now, let us look at their geometric representation. You know that each such equation
has infinitely many solutions. How can we show them in the coordinate plane? You
may have got some indication in which we write the solution as pairs of values. The
solutions of the linear equation in Example 3, namely,
x + 2y = 6 (1)
can be expressed in the form of a table as follows by writing the values of y below the
corresponding values of x :

x 0 2 4 6 . . .
y 3 2 1 0 . . .

In the previous chapter, you
studied how to plot the points on a
graph paper. Let us plot the points
(0, 3), (2, 2), (4, 1) and (6, 0) on a
graph paper. Now join any two of
these points and obtain a line. Let us
call this as line AB (see Fig. 4.2).
Do you see that the other two
points also lie on the line AB? Now,
pick another point on this line, say
(8, –1). Is this a solution? In fact,
8 + 2(–1) = 6. So, (8, –1) is a solution.
Pick any other point on this line AB
and verify whether its coordinates
satisfy the equation or not. Now, take
any point not lying on the line AB, say (2, 0). Do its coordinates satisfy the equation?
Check, and see that they do not.
Let us list our observations:
1. Every point whose coordinates satisfy Equation (1) lies on the line AB.
2. Every point (a, b) on the line AB gives a solution x = a, y = b of Equation (1).
3. Any point, which does not lie on the line AB, is not a solution of Equation (1).
So, you can conclude that every point on the line satisfies the equation of the line
and every solution of the equation is a point on the line. In fact, a linear equation in two
variables is represented geometrically by a line whose points make up the collection of
solutions of the equation. This is called the graph of the linear equation. So, to obtain
the graph of a linear equation in two variables, it is enough to plot two points
corresponding to two solutions and join them by a line. However, it is advisable to plot
more than two such points so that you can immediately check the correctness of the
graph.
Remark : The reason that a, degree one, polynomial equation ax + by + c = 0 is called
a linear equation is that its geometrical representation is a straight line.
Example 5 : Given the point (1, 2), find the equation of a line on which it lies. How
many such equations are there?
Solution : Here (1, 2) is a solution of a linear equation you are looking for. So, you are
looking for any line passing through the point (1, 2). One example of such a linear
equation is x + y = 3. Others are y – x = 1, y = 2x, since they are also satisfied by the
coordinates of the point (1, 2). In fact, there are infinitely many linear equations which
Fig. 4.2
72 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006).PM65
are satisfied by the coordinates of the point (1, 2). Can you see this pictorially?
Example 6 : Draw the graph of x + y = 7.
Solution : To draw the graph, we
need at least two solutions of the
equation. You can check that x = 0,
y = 7, and x = 7, y = 0 are solutions
of the given equation. So, you can
use the following table to draw the
graph:
Table 2
x 0 7
y 7 0
Draw the graph by plotting the
two points from Table 2 and then
by joining the same by a line (see Fig. 4.3).
Example 7 : You know that the force applied on
a body is directly proportional to the acceleration
produced in the body. Write an equation to express
this situation and plot the graph of the equation.
Solution : Here the variables involved are force
and acceleration. Let the force applied be y units
and the acceleration produced be x units. From
ratio and proportion, you can express this fact as
y = kx, where k is a constant. (From your study
of science, you know that k is actually the mass
of the body.)
Now, since we do not know what k is, we cannot
draw the precise graph of y = kx. However, if we
give a certain value to k, then we can draw the
graph. Let us take k = 3, i.e., we draw the line
representing y = 3x.
For this we find two of its solutions, say (0, 0) and
(2, 6) (see Fig. 4.4).
Fig. 4.3
Fig. 4.4
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 73
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006).PM65
From the graph, you can see that when the force applied is 3 units, the acceleration
produced is 1 unit. Also, note that (0, 0) lies on the graph which means the acceleration
produced is 0 units, when the force applied is 0 units.
Remark : The graph of the equation of the form y = kx is a line which always passes
through the origin.
Example 8 : For each of the graphs given in Fig. 4.5 select the equation whose graph
it is from the choices given below:
(a) For Fig. 4.5 (i),
(i) x + y = 0 (ii) y = 2x (iii) y = x (iv) y = 2x + 1
(b) For Fig. 4.5 (ii),
(i) x + y = 0 (ii) y = 2x (iii) y = 2x + 4 (iv) y = x – 4
(c) For Fig. 4.5 (iii),
(i) x + y = 0 (ii) y = 2x (iii) y = 2x + 1 (iv) y = 2x – 4

Solution : (a) In Fig. 4.5 (i), the points on the line are (–1, –2), (0, 0), (1, 2). By
inspection, y = 2x is the equation corresponding to this graph. You can find that the
y-coordinate in each case is double that of the x-coordinate.
(b) In Fig. 4.5 (ii), the points on the line are (–2, 0), (0, 4), (1, 6). You know that the
coordinates of the points of the graph (line) satisfy the equation y = 2x + 4. So,
y = 2x + 4 is the equation corresponding to the graph in Fig. 4.5 (ii).
(c) In Fig. 4.5 (iii), the points on the line are (–1, –6), (0, –4), (1, –2), (2, 0). By inspection,
you can see that y = 2x – 4 is the equation corresponding to the given graph (line).

(v) Is there a temperature which is numerically the same in both Fahrenheit and

4.5 Equations of Lines Parallel to the x-axis and y-axis
You have studied how to write the coordinates of a given point in the Cartesian plane.
Do you know where the points (2, 0), (–3, 0), (4, 0) and (n, 0), for any real number
n, lie in the Cartesian plane? Yes, they all lie on the x-axis. But do you know why?
Because on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of each point is 0. In fact, every point on the
x-axis is of the form (x, 0). Can you now guess the equation of the x-axis? It is given
by y = 0. Note that y = 0 can be expressed as 0.x + 1.y = 0. Similarly, observe that the
equation of the y-axis is given by x = 0.
Now, consider the equation x – 2 = 0. If this is treated as an equation in one
variable x only, then it has the unique solution x = 2, which is a point on the number line.
However, when treated as an equation in two variables, it can be expressed as
76 MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006).PM65
x + 0.y – 2 = 0. This has infinitely many
solutions. In fact, they are all of the form
(2, r), where r is any real number. Also, you
can check that every point of the form (2, r)
is a solution of this equation. So as, an
equation in two variables, x – 2 = 0 is
represented by the line AB in the graph in
Fig. 4.8.
Example 9 : Solve the equation
2x + 1 = x – 3, and represent the solution(s)
on (i) the number line,
(ii) the Cartesian plane.
Solution : We solve 2x + 1 = x – 3, to get
2x – x = –3 – 1
i.e., x = –4
(i) The representation of the solution on the number line is shown in Fig. 4.9, where
x = – 4 is treated as an equation in one variable.
Fig. 4.9
(ii) We know that x = – 4 can be written as
x + 0.y = – 4
which is a linear equation in the variables
x and y. This is represented by a line. Now
all the values of y are permissible because
0.y is always 0. However, x must satisfy the
equation x = – 4. Hence, two solutions of the
given equation are x = – 4, y = 0 and x = – 4,
y = 2.
Note that the graph AB is a line parallel to
the y-axis and at a distance of 4 units to the
left of it (see Fig. 4.10).
