Have you ever thought of the multitude of
life-forms that surround us? Each organism
is different from the other to a lesser or greater
extent. For instance, consider yourself and a
friend.
• Are you both of the same height?
• Does your nose look exactly like your
friend’s nose?
• Is your hand-span the same as your
friend’s?
However, if we were to compare ourselves
and our friends with a monkey, what would
we say? Obviously, we and our friends have
a lot in common when we compare ourselves
with a monkey. But suppose we were to add
a cow to the comparison? We would then
think that the monkey has a lot more in
common with us than with the cow.
Activity ______________ 7.1
• We have heard of ‘desi’ cows and Jersey
cows.
• Does a desi cow look like a Jersey cow?
• Do all desi cows look alike?
• Will we be able to identify a Jersey cow
in a crowd of desi cows that don’t look
like each other?
• What is the basis of our identification?
In this activity, we had to decide which
characteristics were more important in
forming the desired category. Hence, we were
also deciding which characteristics could be
ignored.
Now, think of all the different forms in
which life occurs on earth. On one hand we
have microscopic bacteria of a few micrometre
in size. While on the other hand we have blue
whale and red wood trees of California
of approximate sizes of 30 metres and
100 metres respectively. Some pine trees live
for thousands of years while insects like
mosquitoes die within a few days. Life also
ranges from colourless or even transparent
worms to brightly coloured birds and flowers.
This bewildering variety of life around us
has evolved on the earth over millions of
years. However, we do not have more than a
tiny fraction of this time to try and
understand all these living organisms, so we
cannot look at them one by one. Instead, we
look for similarities among the organisms,
which will allow us to put them into different
classes and then study different classes or
groups as a whole.
In order to make relevant groups to study
the variety of life forms, we need to decide
which characteristics decide more
fundamental differences among organisms.
This would create the main broad groups of
organisms. Within these groups, smaller subgroups will be decided by less important
characteristics.

1. Why do we classify organisms?
2. Give three examples of the range
of variations that you see in lifeforms around you.
7.1 What is the Basis of
Classification?
Attempts at classifying living things into
groups have been made since time
immemorial. Greek thinker Aristotle classified
animals according to whether they lived on
Q

land, in water or in the air. This is a very
simple way of looking at life, but misleading
too. For example, animals that live in the sea
include corals, whales, octopuses, starfish
and sharks. We can immediately see that
these are very different from each other in
numerous ways. In fact, habitat is the only
point they share in common. This is not an
appropriate way of making groups of
organisms to study and think about.
We therefore need to decide which
characteristics to be used as the basis for
making the broadest divisions. Then we will
have to pick the next set of characteristics
for making sub-groups within these divisions.
This process of classification within each
group can then continue using new
characteristics each time.
Before we go on, we need to think about
what is meant by ‘characteristics’. When we
are trying to classify a diverse group of
organisms, we need to find ways in which
some of them are similar enough to be
thought of together. These ‘ways’, in fact, are
details of appearance or behaviour, in other
words, form and function.
What we mean by a characteristic is a
particular feature or a particular function. That
most of us have five fingers on each hand is
thus a characteristic. That we can run, but the
banyan tree cannot, is also a characteristic.
Now, to understand how some
characteristics are decided as being more
fundamental than others, let us consider how
a stone wall is built. The stones used will have
different shapes and sizes. The stones at the
top of the wall would not influence the choice
of stones that come below them. On the other
hand, the shapes and sizes of stones in the
lowermost layer will decide the shape and size
of the next layer and so on.
The stones in the lowermost layer are like
the characteristics that decide the broadest
divisions among living organisms. They are
independent of any other characteristics in
their effects on the form and function of the
organism. The characteristics in the next level
would be dependent on the previous one and
would decide the variety in the next level. In
this way, we can build up a whole hierarchy
of mutually related characteristics to be used
for classification.
Now-a-days, we look at many inter-related
characteristics starting from the nature of the
cell in order to classify all living organisms.
What are some concrete examples of such
characteristics used for a hierarchical
classification?
• A eukaryotic cell has membrane-bound
organelles, including a nucleus, which
allow cellular processes to be carried out
efficiently in isolation from each other.
Therefore, organisms which do not have
a clearly demarcated nucleus and other
organelles would need to have their
biochemical pathways organised in very
different ways. This would have an effect
on every aspect of cell design. Further,
nucleated cells would have the capacity
to participate in making a multicellular
organism because they can take up
specialised functions. Therefore, nucleus
can be a basic characteristic of
classification.
• Do the cells occur singly or are they
grouped together and do they live as an
indivisible group? Cells that group
together to form a single organism use
the principle of division of labour. In such
a body design, all cells would not be
identical. Instead, groups of cells will
carry out specialised functions. This
makes a very basic distinction in the
body designs of organisms. As a result,
an Amoeba and a worm are very different
in their body design.
• Do organisms produce their own food
through the process of photosynthesis?
Being able to produce one’s own
food versus having to get food from
outside would make very different
body designs.
• Of the organisms that perform
photosynthesis (plants), what is the level
of organisation of their body?
• Of the animals, how does the individual’s
body develop and organise its different
parts, and what are the specialised
organs found for different functions?
DIVERSITY IN LIVING ORGANISMS 81
2021-22
82 SCIENCE
We can see that, even in these few questions
that we have asked, a hierarchy is developing.
The characteristics of body design used for
classification of plants will be very different
from those important for classifying animals.
This is because the basic designs are different,
based on the need to make their own food
(plants), or acquire it (animals). Therefore,
these design features (having a skeleton, for
example) are to be used to make sub-groups,
rather than making broad groups.

characteristic for classifying

(b) the kind of cells they are
made of. Why?
2. What is the primary characteristic
on which the broad division of
organisms is made?
3. On what bases are plants and
animals put into different
categories?
7.2 Classification and Evolution
All living things are identified and categorised
on the basis of their body design in form and
function. Some characteristics are likely to
make more wide-ranging changes in body
design than others. There is a role of time in
this as well. So, once a certain body design
comes into existence, it will shape the effects
of all other subsequent design changes,
simply because it already exists. In other
words, characteristics that came into
existence earlier are likely to be more basic
than characteristics that have come into
existence later.
This means that the classification of life
forms will be closely related to their evolution.
What is evolution? Most life forms that we
see today have arisen by an accumulation of
changes in body design that allow the
organism possessing them to survive better.
Charles Darwin first described this idea of
evolution in 1859 in his book, The Origin of
Species.
When we connect this idea of evolution to
classification, we will find some groups of
organisms which have ancient body designs
that have not changed very much. We will
also find other groups of organisms that have
acquired their particular body designs
relatively recently. Those in the first group
are frequently referred to as ‘primitive’ or ‘lower’
organisms, while those in the second group
are called ‘advanced’ or ‘higher’ organisms. In
reality, these terms are not quite correct since
they do not properly relate to the differences.
All that we can say is that some are ‘older’
organisms, while some are ‘younger’
organisms. Since there is a possibility that
complexity in design will increase over
evolutionary time, it may not be wrong to say
that older organisms are simpler, while Q younger organisms are more complex. More to know
Biodiversity means the diversity of life
forms. It is a word commonly used to
refer to the variety of life forms found
in a particular region. Diverse life forms
share the environment, and are
affected by each other too. As a result,
a stable community of different species
comes into existence. Humans have
played their own part in recent times
in changing the balance of such
communities. Of course, the diversity
in such communities is affected by
particular characteristics of land,
water, climate and so on. Rough
estimates state that there are about ten
million species on the planet, although
we actually know only one or two
millions of them. The warm and humid
tropical regions of the earth, between
the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of
Capricorn, are rich in diversity of plant
and animal life. This is called the region
of megadiversity. Of the biodiversity
on the planet, more than half is
concentrated in a few countries —
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Mexico, Zaire, Madagascar,
Australia, China, India, Indonesia and
Malaysia.

Why?
7.3 The Hierarchy of ClassificationGroups
Biologists, such as Ernst Haeckel (1894),
Robert Whittaker (1969) and Carl Woese
(1977) have tried to classify all living
organisms into broad categories, called
kingdoms. The classification Whittaker
proposed has five kingdoms: Monera,
Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia, and
is widely used. These groups are formed on
the basis of their cell structure, mode and
source of nutrition and body organisation.
The modification Woese introduced by
dividing the Monera into Archaebacteria (or
Archaea) and Eubacteria (or Bacteria) is also
in use.
Further classification is done by naming
the sub-groups at various levels as given in
the following scheme:
Kingdom
Phylum (for animals) / Division (for plants)
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species
Thus, by separating organisms on the
basis of a hierarchy of characteristics into
smaller and smaller groups, we arrive at the
basic unit of classification, which is a
‘species’. So what organisms can be said to
belong to the same species? Broadly, a species
includes all organisms that are similar
enough to breed and perpetuate.
The important characteristics of the five
kingdoms of Whittaker are as follows:
7.3.1 MONERA
These organisms do not have a defined
nucleus or organelles, nor do any of them
show multi-cellular body designs. On the
other hand, they show diversity based on
many other characteristics. Some of them
have cell walls while some do not. Of course,
having or not having a cell wall has very
different effects on body design here from
having or not having a cell wall in multicellular organisms. The mode of nutrition of
organisms in this group can be either by
synthesising their own food (autotrophic) or
getting it from the environment
(heterotrophic). This group includes bacteria,
blue-green algae or cyanobacteria, and
mycoplasma. Some examples are shown
in Fig. 7.1.

eukaryotic organisms. Some of these
organisms use appendages, such as hair-like
cilia or whip-like flagella for moving around.
Their mode of nutrition can be autotrophic
or heterotrophic. Examples are unicellular
algae, diatoms and protozoans (see Fig. 7.2
for examples).

are called parasites. Many of them have the
capacity to become multicellular organisms at

Some fungal species live in permanent
mutually dependent relationships with bluegreen algae (or cyanobacteria). Such
relationships are called symbiotic. These
symbiobic life forms are called lichens. We have
all seen lichens as the slow-growing large
coloured patches on the bark of trees.
7.3.4 PLANTAE
These are multicellular eukaryotes with cell
walls. They are autotrophs and use
chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Thus, all
plants are included in this group. Since plants
and animals are most visible forms of the
diversity of life around us, we will look at the
subgroups in this category later (section 7.4).
7.3.5 ANIMALIA
These include all organisms which are
multicellular eukaryotes without cell walls.
They are heterotrophs. Again, we will look at
their subgroups a little later in section 7.5.

Q
7.4 Plantae
The first level of classification among plants
depends on whether the plant body has welldifferentiated, distinct parts. The next level of
classification is based on whether the
differentiated plant body has special tissues
for the transport of water and other
substances. Further classification looks at the
ability to bear seeds and whether the seeds
are enclosed within fruits.
7.4.1 THALLOPHYTA
Plants that do not have well-differentiated body
design fall in this group. The plants in this
group are commonly called algae. These plants

are predominantly aquatic. Examples are
Spirogyra, Ulothrix, Cladophora, Ulva and
Chara (see Fig. 7.5).
7.4.2 BRYOPHYTA
These are called the amphibians of the plant
kingdom. The plant body is commonly
differentiated to form stem and leaf-like
structures. However, there is no specialised
tissue for the conduction of water and other
substances from one part of the plant body
to another. Examples are moss (Funaria) and
Marchantia (see Fig. 7.6).

7.4.3 PTERIDOPHYTA

into roots, stem and leaves and has
specialised tissue for the conduction of water
and other substances from one part of the
plant body to another. Some examples are
Marsilea, ferns and horse-tails (see Fig. 7.7).
The reproductive organs of plants in all
these three groups are very inconspicuous,
and they are therefore called ‘cryptogams’, or
‘those with hidden reproductive organs’.
On the other hand, plants with welldifferentiated reproductive parts that
ultimately make seeds are called
Riccia

phanerogams. Seeds are the result of sexual
reproduction process. They consist of the
embryo along with stored food, which assists
for the initial growth of the embryo during
germination. This group is further classified,
based on whether the seeds are naked or
enclosed in fruits, giving us two groups:
gymnosperms and angiosperms.
7.4.4 GYMNOSPERMS
This term is derived from two Greek words:
gymno– means naked and sperma– means
seed. The plants of this group bear naked
seeds and are usually perennial, evergreen
and woody. Examples are pines and deodar
(see Fig. 7.8 for examples).
7.4.5 ANGIOSPERMS
This word is made from two Greek words:
angio means covered and sperma– means
seed. These are also called flowering plants.
The seeds develop inside an ovary which is
modified to become a fruit. Plant embryos in
seeds have structures called cotyledons.
Cotyledons are called ‘seed leaves’ because in
many instances they emerge and become
green when the seed germinates. The
angiosperms are divided into two groups on
the basis of the number of cotyledons present
in the seed. Plants with seeds having a single
cotyledon are called monocotyledonous or
monocots. Plants with seeds having two
cotyledons are called dicots (see Figs. 7.9
and 7.10).

7.5 Animalia
These are organisms which are eukaryotic,
multicellular and heterotrophic. Their cells
do not have cell-walls. Most animals are
mobile.
They are further classified based on the
extent and type of the body design
differentiation found.
7.5.1 PORIFERA
The word Porifera means organisms with
holes. These are non-motile animals attached
to some solid support. There are holes or
‘pores’, all over the body. These lead to a canal
system that helps in circulating water
throughout the body to bring in food and
oxygen. These animals are covered with a
hard outside layer or skeleton. The body
design involves very minimal differentiation
and division into tissues. They are commonly
called sponges, and are mainly found in
marine habitats. Some examples are shown
in Fig. 7.12.
layers of cells: one makes up cells on the
outside of the body, and the other makes the
inner lining of the body. Some of these species
live in colonies (corals), while others have a
solitary like–span (Hydra). Jellyfish and sea
anemones are common examples (see
Fig. 7.13).

7.5.3 PLATYHELMINTHES
The body of animals in this group is far more
complexly designed than in the two other
groups we have considered so far. The body
is bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that the
left and the right halves of the body have the
same design. There are three layers of cells
from which differentiated tissues can be
made, which is why such animals are called
triploblastic. This allows outside and inside
body linings as well as some organs to be
made. There is thus some degree of tissue
formation. However, there is no true internal
body cavity or coelom, in which welldeveloped organs can be accommodated. The
body is flattened dorsoventrally (meaning from
top to bottom), which is why these animals are
called flatworms. They are either free-living or
parasitic. Some examples are free-living
animals like planarians, or parasitic animals
like liverflukes (see Fig. 7.14 for examples).

7.5.5 ANNELIDA
Annelid animals are also bilaterally
symmetrical and triploblastic, but in addition
they have a true body cavity. This allows true
organs to be packaged in the body structure.
There is, thus, extensive organ differentiation.
This differentiation occurs in a segmental
fashion, with the segments lined up one after
the other from head to tail. These animals
are found in a variety of habitats– fresh water,
marine water as well as land. Earthworms
and leeches are familiar examples (see

There are tissues, but no real organs,
although a sort of body cavity or a pseudocoelom, is present. These are very familiar
as parasitic worms causing diseases, such

worms) or the worms in the intestines

‘arthropod’ means ‘jointed legs’). Some
familiar examples are prawns, butterflies,

used for moving around. Examples are snails

7.5.8 ECHINODERMATA
In Greek, echinos means hedgehog (spiny
mammal), and derma means skin. Thus, these
are spiny skinned organisms. These are
exclusively free-living marine animals. They
are triploblastic and have a coelomic cavity.
They also have a peculiar water-driven tube
system that they use for moving around. They
have hard calcium carbonate structures that
they use as a skeleton. Examples are sea-stars
and sea urchins (see Fig. 7.19).

These animals are bilaterally symmetrical,

they show a new feature of body design,
namely a notochord, at least at some stages
during their lives. The notochord is a long
rod-like support structure (chord=string) that
runs along the back of the animal separating
the nervous tissue from the gut. It provides a
place for muscles to attach for ease of
movement. Protochordates may not have a
proper notochord present at all stages in their
lives or for the entire length of the animal.
Protochordates are marine animals. Examples
are Balanoglossus, Herdmania and

They lay eggs. We can think of many kinds of
fish, some with skeletons made entirely of
cartilage, such as sharks, and some with a
skeleton made of both bone and cartilage, such
as tuna or rohu [see examples in Figs. 7.22 (a)

to us produce live young ones. However, a
few of them, like the platypus and the echidna
lay eggs, and some, like kangaroos give birth
to very poorly developed young ones. Some
examples are shown in Fig. 7.26.
The scheme of classification of animals is
shown in Fig. 7.27.

Q
Carolus Linnaeus (Karl
von Linne) was born in
Sweden and was a doctor
by professsion. He was
interested in the study of
plants. At the age of 22, he
published his first paper on
plants. While serving as a
personal physician of a
wealthy government
official, he studied the diversity of plants
in his employer’s garden. Later, he
published 14 papers and also brought out
the famous book Systema Naturae from
which all fundamental taxonomical
researches have taken off. His system of
classification was a simple scheme for
arranging plants so as to be able to identify
them again.

7.6 Nomenclature
Why is there a need for systematic naming of
living organisms?
Activity ______________ 7.3
• Find out the names of the following
animals and plants in as many
languages as you can:
1. Tiger 2. Peacock 3. Ant
4. Neem 5. Lotus 6. Potato
As you might be able to appreciate, it
would be difficult for people speaking or
writing in different languages to know when
they are talking about the same organism. This
problem was resolved by agreeing upon a
‘scientific’ name for organisms in the same
manner that chemical symbols and formulae
for various substances are used the world over.
The scientific name for an organism is thus
unique and can be used to identify it
anywhere in the world.
The system of scientific naming or
nomenclature we use today was introduced
by Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth
century. The scientific name of an organism is
the result of the process of classification
which puts it along with the organisms it is
most related to. But when we actually name
the species, we do not list out the whole
hierarchy of groups it belongs to. Instead, we
limit ourselves to writing the name of the genus
and species of that particular organism. World
over, it has been agreed that both these names
will be used in Latin forms.
Certain conventions are followed while
writing the scientific names:
1. The name of the genus begins with a
capital letter.
2. The name of the species begins with a
small letter.
3. When printed, the scientific name is
given in italics.
4. When written by hand, the genus name
and the species name have to be
underlined separately.
Activity ______________ 7.4
• Find out the scientific names of any
five common animals and plants. Do
these names have anything in
common with the names you normally
use to identify them?
What
you have
learnt
• Classification helps us in exploring the diversity of life forms.
• The major characteristics considered for classifying all
organisms into five major kingdoms are:
(a) whether they are made of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells
(b) whether the cells are living singly or organised into
multi-cellular and thus complex organisms
(c) whether the cells have a cell-wall and whether they
prepare their own food.
• All living organisms are divided on the above bases into five
kingdoms, namely Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and
Animalia.
• The classification of life forms is related to their evolution.

• Plantae and Animalia are further divided into subdivisions
on the basis of increasing complexity of body organisation.
• Plants are divided into five groups: Thallophytes, Bryophytes,
Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms.
• Animals are divided into ten groups: Porifera, Coelenterata,
Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca,
Echinodermata, Protochordata and Vertebrata.
• The binomial nomenclature makes for a uniform way of
identification of the vast diversity of life around us.
• The binomial nomenclature is made up of two words – a generic
name and a specific name.
Exercises
1. What are the advantages of classifying organisms?
2. How would you choose between two characteristics to be used
for developing a hierarchy in classification?
3. Explain the basis for grouping organisms into five kingdoms.
4. What are the major divisions in the Plantae? What is the basis
for these divisions?
5. How are the criteria for deciding divisions in plants different
from the criteria for deciding the subgroups among animals?
6. Explain how animals in Vertebrata are classified into further
subgroups.
