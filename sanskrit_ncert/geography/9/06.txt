POPULATION*
C
an you imagine a world without human
beings? Who would have utilised
resources and created the social and
cultural environment? The people are
important to develop the economy and society.
The people make and use resources and are
themselves resources with varying quality.
Coal is but a piece of rock, until people were
able to invent technology to obtain it and make
it a ‘resource’. Natural events like a river flood
or Tsunami becomes a ‘disaster’ only when
they affect a crowded village or a town.
Hence, population is the pivotal element in
social studies. It is the point of reference from
which all other elements are observed and from
which they derive significance and meaning.
‘Resources’, ‘calamities’ and ‘disasters’ are all
meaningful only in relation to human beings.
Their numbers, distribution, growth and
characteristics or qualities provide the basic
background for understanding and
appreciating all aspects of the environment.
Human beings are producers and
consumers of earth’s resources. Therefore, it
is important to know how many people are
there in a country, where do they live, how and
why their numbers are increasing and what
are their characteristics. The census of India
provides us with information regarding the
population of our country.
We are primarily concerned with three
major questions about the population:
(i) Population size and distribution: How
many people are there and where are they
located?
(ii) Population growth and processes of
population change: How has the
population grown and changed through
time?
(iii) Characteristics or qualities of the
population: What are their age, sexcomposition, literacy levels, occupational
structure and health conditions?
POPULATION SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION
India’s Population Size and Distribution by
Numbers
India’s population as on March 2001 stood at
1,028 million, which account for 16.7 per cent
of the world’s population. These 1.02 billion
people are unevenly distributed over our
country’s vast area of 3.28 million square km,
which accounts for 2.4 per cent of the world’s
area (Figure 6.1).
The 2001 Census data reveals that Uttar
Pradesh with a population size of 166 million
people is the most populous state of India. Uttar
Pradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of the
Census
A census is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India the first census was held in the year
1872. The first complete census, however was taken in the year 1881. Since then censuses have been held
regularly every tenth year.
The Indian Census is the most comprehensive source of demographic, social and economic data. Have you
ever seen a census report? Check in your library if it has one.

area. India is one of the most densely populated
countries of the world.
The population density of India in the year
2001 was 324 persons per sq km. Densities
vary from 904 persons per sq km in West
Bengal to only 13 persons per sq km in
Arunachal Pradesh. A study of the figure 6.3
shows the pattern of uneven distribution of
population densities at the state level.
Activity
Study the figure 6.3 and compare it with
figure 2.4 and figure 4.7. Do you find any
corelation between these maps?
Note the states with population densities
below 250 persons per square km. Rugged
terrain and unfavourable climatic conditions
are primarily responsible for sparse population
in these areas. Which states have density below
100 persons per square km?
Assam and most of the Peninsular states
have moderate population densities. Hilly,
dissected and rocky nature of the terrain,
moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less
fertile soils have influenced population
densities in these areas.
The Northern Plains and Kerala in the
south have high to very high population
densities because of the flat plains with fertile
soils and abundant rainfall. Identify the three
states of the Northern Plains with high
population densities.
POPULATION GROWTH AND PROCESSES OF
POPULATION CHANGE
Population is a dynamic phenomenon. The
numbers, distribution and composition of the
population are constantly changing. This is the
influence of the interaction of the three processes,
namely-births, deaths and migrations.

Table 6.1 and figure 6.4 reveal that from
1951 to 1981, the annual rate of population
growth was steadily increasing; which
explains the rapid increase in population
from 361 million in 1951 to 683 million in
1981.
• Table 6.1 reveals that despite the
decline in growth rates, the number of people being
added every decade is steadily increasing. Why?
Since 1981, however, the rate of growth
started declining gradually. During this
period, birth rates declined rapidly. Still 182
million people were added to the total
population in the 1990s alone (an annual
addition larger than ever before).
It is essential to realise that India has a very
large population. When a low annual rate is
applied to a very large population, it yields a
large absolute increase. When more than a
billion people increase even at a lower rate, the
total numbers being added becomes very large.
India’s current annual increase in population
of 15.5 million is large enough to neutralise
efforts to conserve the resource endowment
and environment.
 The declining trend of the growth rate is
indeed a positive indicator of the efforts of birth
control. Despite that, the total additions to the
population base continue to grow, and India
may overtake China in 2045 to become the
most populous country in the world.
Population Growth
Growth of population refers to the change in
the number of inhabitants of a country/territory
during a specific period of time, say during the
last ten years. Such a change can be expressed
in two ways: in terms of absolute numbers and
in terms of percentage change per year.
The absolute numbers added each year or
decade is the magnitude of increase. It is
obtained by simply subtracting the earlier
population (e.g. that of 1991) from the later
population (e.g. that of 2001). It is referred to
as the absolute increase.
The rate or the pace of population increase
is the other important aspect. It is studied in
per cent per annum, e.g. a rate of increase of 2
per cent per annum means that in a given year,
there was an increase of two persons for every
100 persons in the base population. This is
referred to as the annual growth rate.
India’s population has been steadily
increasing from 361 million in 1951 to 1028
million in 2001.

POPULATION 57
Processes of Population Change/Growth
There are three main processes of change of
population : birth rates, death rates and
migration.
The natural increase of population is the
difference between birth rates and death rates.
Birth rate is the number of live births per
thousand persons in a year. It is a major
component of growth because in India, birth
rates have always been higher than death
rates.
Death rate is the number of deaths per
thousand persons in a year. The main cause
of the rate of growth of the Indian population
has been the rapid decline in death rates.
Till 1980, high birth rates and declining
death rates led to a large difference between
birth rates and death rates resulting in higher
rates of population growth. Since 1981, birth
rates have also started declining gradually,
resulting in a gradual decline in the rate of
population growth. What are the reasons for
this trend?
The third component of population growth
is migration. Migration is the movement of
people across regions and territories. Migration
can be internal (within the country) or
international (between the countries).
Internal migration does not change the size
of the population, but influences the distribution
of population within the nation. Migration plays
a very significant role in changing the composition
and distribution of population.
Activity
On a map, trace the migration of each
of your grandparents and parents
since their birth. Try and analyse the
reasons for each move.
In India, most migrations have been from
rural to urban areas because of the “push”
factor in rural areas. These are adverse
conditions of poverty and unemployment in the
rural areas and the “pull” of the city in terms
of increased employment opportunities and
better living conditions.
Migration is an important determinant of
population change. It changes not only the
population size but also the population
composition of urban and rural populations
in terms of age and sex composition. In India,
the rural-urban migration has resulted in a
steady increase in the percentage of population
in cities and towns. The urban population has
increased from 17.29 per cent of the total
population in 1951 to 27.78 per cent in 2001.
There has been a significant increase in the
number of ‘million plus cities’ from 23 to 35 in
just one decade i.e. 1991 to 2001.
Age Composition
The age composition of a population refers to
the number of people in different age groups
in a country. It is one of the most basic
characteristics of a population. To an important
degree, a person’s age influences what he
needs, buys, does and his capacity to perform.
Consequently, the number and percentage of
a population found within the children,
working age and aged groups are notable
determinants of the population’s social and
economic structure.
The population of a nation is generally
grouped into three broad categories:
Children (generally below 15 years)
They are economically unproductive and need
to be provided with food, clothing, education
and medical care.
Figure 6.5: India: Age Composition
Adults, 58.7%
Aged, 6.9%
Children, 34.4%
India : Age Structure
2015-16
58 CONTEMPORARY INDIA
Working Age (15-59 years)
They are economically productive and
biologically reproductive. They comprise the
working population.
Aged (Above 59 years)
 They can be economically productive though
they may have retired. They may be working
voluntarily but they are not available for
employment through recruitment.
The percentage of children and the aged
affect the dependency ratio because these
groups are not producers. The proportion of
the three groups in India’s population is
already presented in figure 6.5 .
Activity :
(i) How many children do you know who are
engaged as household helpers, labourers in
your locality?
(ii) How many adults do you know in your locality
who are unemployed?
(iii) What do you feel are the reasons for this?
Sex Ratio
Sex ratio is defined as the number of females
per 1000 males in the population. This
information is an important social indicator
to measure the extent of equality between
males and females in a society at a given time.
The sex ratio in the country has always
remained unfavourable to females. Find out
why this is so? Table 6.2 shows the sex ratio
from 1951-2001.

• Kerala has a sex ratio of 1058
females per 1000 males, Pondicherry has 1001
females for every 1000 males, while Delhi has
only 821 females per 1000 males and Haryana
has just 861.
• What could be the reasons for such
variations?
Literacy Rates
Literacy is a very important quality of a
population. Obviously, only an informed and
educated citizen can make intelligent choices
and undertake research and development
projects. Low levels of literacy are a serious
obstacle for economic improvement.
According to the Census of 2001, a person
aged 7 years. and above who can read and
write with understanding in any language, is
treated as literate.
There has been a steady improvement in
the literacy levels in India. The literacy rate in
the country as per the Census of 2001 is 64.84
per cent; 75.26 per cent for males and 53.67
per cent for females. Why do such differences
exist?
Occupational Structure
The percentage of population that is
economically active is an important index of
development. The distribution of the
population according to different types of
occupation is referred to as the occupational
structure. An enormous variety of occupations
are found in any country. Occupations are
generally classified as primary, secondary, and
tertiary.
Primary activities include agriculture,
animal husbandry, forestry, fishing, mining
and quarrying etc. Secondary activities include
manufacturing industry, building and
construction work etc. Tertiary activities
include transport, communications,
commerce, administration and other services.
The proportion of people working in
different activities varies in developed and
developing countries. Developed nations have
a high proportion of people in secondary, and
tertiary activities. Developing countries tend
to have a higher proportion of their workforce
engaged in primary activities. In India, about
64 per cent of the population is engaged only
in agriculture. The proportion of population
dependent on secondary and tertiary sectors
2015-16
POPULATION 59
is about 13 and 20 per cent respectively. There
has been an occupational shift in favour of
secondary and tertiary sectors because of
growing industrialisation and urbanisation in
recent times.
Health
Health is an important component of
population composition, which affects the
process of development. Sustained efforts of
government programmes have registered
significant improvements in the health
conditions of the Indian population. Death
rates have declined from 25 per 1000
population in 1951 to 8.1 per 1000 in 2001
and life expectancy at birth has increased from
36.7 years in 1951 to 64.6 years in 2001.
The substantial improvement is the result
of many factors including improvement in
public health, prevention of infectious diseases
and application of modern medical practices
in diagnosis and treatment of ailments.
Despite considerable achievements, the
health situation is a matter of major concern
for India. The per capita calorie consumption
is much below the recommended levels and
malnutrition afflicts a large percentage of our
population. Safe drinking water and basic
sanitation amenities are available to only onethird of the rural population. These problems
need to be tackled through an appropriate
population policy.
Adolescent Population
The most significant feature of the Indian
population is the size of its adolescent
population. It constitutes one-fifth of the total
population of India. Adolescents are generally
grouped in the age-group of 10 to 19 years.
They are the most important resource for the
future. Nutrition requirements of adolescents
are higher than those of a normal child or adult.
Poor nutrition can lead to deficiency and
stunted growth. But in India, the diet available
to adolescents is inadequate in all nutrients. A
large number of adolescent girls suffer from
anaemia. Their problems have so far not
received adequate attention in the process of
development. The adolescent girls have to be
sensitised to the problems they confront. Their
awareness can be improved through the spread
of literacy and education among them.
National Population Policy
Recognising that the planning of families would
improve individual health and welfare, the
Government of India initiated the
comprehensive Family Planning Programme in
1952. The Family Welfare Programme has
sought to promote responsible and planned
parenthood on a voluntary basis. The National
Population Policy 2000 is a culmination of
years of planned efforts.
The NPP 2000 provides a policy framework
for imparting free and compulsory school
education up to 14 years of age, reducing
infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live
births, achieving universal immunisation of
children against all vaccine preventable
diseases, promoting delayed marriage for girls,
and making family welfare a people-centered
programme.
NPP 2000 and Adolescents
NPP 2000 identified adolescents as one of the
major sections of the population that need
greater attention. Besides nutritional
requirements, the policy put greater emphasis
on other important needs of adolescents
including protection from unwanted
pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases
(STD). It called for programmes that aim
towards encouraging delayed marriage and
child-bearing, education of adolescents about
the risks of unprotected sex, making
contraceptive services accessible and
affordable, providing food supplements,
nutritional services, strengthening legal
measures to prevent child marriage.
People are the nation’s most valuable
resource. A well- educated healthy population
provides potential power.
